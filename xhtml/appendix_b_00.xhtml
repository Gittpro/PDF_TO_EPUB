        <p>In Kindergarten, instructional time should focus on two critical areas:</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p>representing and comparing whole numbers, initially with sets of objects; and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>describing shapes and space.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="source"><em>Source: Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</em> was developed by the Council of
            Chief State School Officers. Copies may be downloaded at <a href="http://www.ccsso.org/"
                class="ulink">http://www.ccsso.org/</a>.</p>
        <p><span id="pageb2" class="pagebreak" title="B-2" />More learning time in Kindergarten should be devoted to
            number than to other topics.</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p><strong><em>Students use numbers, including written numerals, to represent quantities and to solve
                            quantitative problems, such as counting objects in a set; counting out a given number of
                            objects; comparing sets or numerals; and modeling simple joining and separating situations
                            with sets of objects, or eventually with equations such as</em> <math alttext="5 plus 2 equals 7 space a n d space 7 minus 2 equals 5." xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math.png"><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>d</mi><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></math>.</strong> (Kindergarten students should see addition and subtraction equations,
                    and student writing of equations in kindergarten is encouraged, but it is not required.) Students
                    choose, combine, and apply effective strategies for answering quantitative questions, including
                    quickly recognizing the cardinalities of small sets of objects, counting and producing sets of given
                    sizes, counting the number of objects in combined sets, or counting the number of objects that
                    remain in a set after some are taken away.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong><em>Students describe their physical world using geometric ideas (e.g., shape, orientation,
                            spatial relations) and vocabulary.</em></strong> They identify, name, and describe basic
                    two-dimensional shapes, such as squares, triangles, circles, rectangles, and hexagons, presented in
                    a variety of ways (e.g., with different sizes and orientations), as well as three-dimensional shapes
                    such as cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres. They use basic shapes and spatial reasoning to model
                    objects in their environment and to construct more complex shapes.</p>
