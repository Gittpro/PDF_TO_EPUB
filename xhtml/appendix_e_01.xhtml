<h3 class="title">Card Stock Materials</h3>
</header>
<p>A good way to have many materials made quickly and easily for children is to have them duplicated on card stock, laminated, and then cut into smaller pieces if desired. Once cut, materials are best kept in clear freezer bags with zip-type closures. Punch a hole near the top of the bag so that you do not store air.</p>
<p>The following list is a suggestion for materials that can be made from card stock using the masters in this section. Quantity suggestions are also given.</p>
<p><strong>Five-Frames and Ten-Frames&#8212;12&#8211;14</strong></p>
<p>Five-frames and ten-frames are best duplicated on light-colored card stock. Do not laminate; if you do, the mats will curl and counters will slide around.</p>
<p><strong><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="10 cross times 10" altimg="../images/render.png"><mn>10</mn><mo>&#xD7;</mo><mn>10</mn></math> Multiplication Array&#8212;16</strong></p>
<p>Make one per child in any color. Lamination is suggested. Provide each child with an L-shaped piece of card stock to frame the array.</p>
<p><strong>Base-Ten Materials&#8212;32</strong></p>
<p>Run copies on white card stock. One sheet will make 4 hundreds and 10 tens or 4 hundreds and 100 ones. Cut into pieces with a paper cutter. It is recommended that you not laminate the base-ten pieces. A kit consisting of 10 hundreds, 30 tens, and 30 ones is adequate for each child or pair of children.</p>
<p><strong>Place-Value Mat (with Ten-Frames)&#8212;17</strong></p>
<p>Mats can be duplicated on any pastel card stock. It is recommended that you not laminate these because they tend to curl and counters slide around. Make one for every child.<span id="pagee3" class="pagebreak" title="E-3" /></p>
<p><strong>Rational Number Wheel&#8212;24</strong></p>
<p>These disks should be made on card stock. Duplicate the master on two contrasting colors. Laminate and cut the circles and also the slot on the dotted line. Make a set for each child.</p>
<p>Many masters lend themselves to demonstration purposes. The <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="10 cross times 10" altimg="../images/render.png"><mn>10</mn><mo>&#xD7;</mo><mn>10</mn></math> array, the blank hundreds board, and the large geoboard are examples. The place-value mat can be used with strips and squares or with counters and cups directly on the document camera. The missing-part blank and the record blanks for the four algorithms are pages that you may wish to write on as a demonstration.</p>
<p>The 10,000 grid is the easiest way there is to show 10,000 or to model four-place decimal numbers.</p>
<p>The degrees and wedges page is the very best way to illustrate what a degree is and also to help explain protractors.</p>
<p>All of the line and dot grids are useful for modeling. You may find it a good idea to have several copies of each easily available.</p>

<p>2 rows of 3 handouts appear as follows, from left to right and top to bottom. Number cards 0 to 10; a 3 by 4 array of cards with one rectangle blank; a blank hundreds chart is a 10 by 10 array of squares; a hundreds chart is a 10 by 10 array with numbers 1 to 100; 4 small hundred charts are 4 on each page; 2 centimeter grid paper is an 11 by 9 array of squares; and 1 centimeter grid paper is a 16 by 22 array of squares.</p></details>

<p>The handouts are as follows: a 0.5 centimeter grid paper is an array of half centimeter squares, a 1 centimeter dot paper is an array of dots each a centimeter apart, a 2 centimeter isometric grid paper is a grid of triangles with every other one inverted, a 1 centimeter isometric dot paper is repeating rows of dots with each row containing 10 dots and every other row shifting right, a 1 centimeter square diagonal grid paper is an array of squares that is further divided by rising and by falling diagonals that intersect every other vertex to form a pattern of triangles and squares, a five frame is a set of 5 connected rectangles, a ten frame is a 2 by 5 array of connected rectangles, a horizontal ten frame is larger and rotated, and a double ten frame is 2 sets of ten frames.</p></details>

<p>The handouts are as follows. A 10 by 10 multiplication array is a 10 by 10 array of circles divided into 4 equal parts by a vertical and a horizontal. A place value mat with ten frames is divided into 2 parts with one part labeled tens and the other labeled ones and containing 2 ten frames. A base ten grid paper is an array of small squares. A 10,000 grid paper is a square grid of 10,000 small squares divided by 2 horizontals and 2 verticals. An addition and subtraction recording sheet has a set of 4 place value mats to the tens place and 6 place value mats to the hundreds place. Each mat is a rectangle divided by a horizontal below the center with the first 4 mats further divided by 1 vertical with the left column the tens place, having a rod above and the right column, the ones place having a square over it, and the second 6 mats having a second vertical with the hundreds place in the left column with a large square over it and remaining columns tens and ones. A coordinate grid quadrant 1 is a 20 by 20 array of squares with the origin at the lower left vertex, the x-axis extending along the lower side of the array and the y-axis extending along the left side of the array. A coordinate grid 4 quadrants is an 18 by 18 array of squares that is divided by a vertical y-axis and a horizontal x-axis into 4 equal parts to show 4 quadrants of a coordinate system.</p></details>

<p>The handouts are as follows. A 10 by 10 grid is a set of 4 10 by 10 grids each with 4 horizontal lines below. A geoboard pattern, 5 by 5, is a square with a 5 by 5 array of dots. A geoboard recording sheet is a set of 4 squares each with a 5 by 5 array of dots. A geoboard pattern, 10 by 10 is a square with a 10 by 10 array of dots. A geoboard pattern recording sheets, 10 by 10, is a set of four squares each with a 10 by 10 array of dots. A degrees and wedges sheet has a shaded half circle, 180 degrees, and a set of 9 segments that extend from a single point, are an equal distance apart from each other and span 180 degrees from the first segment to the ninth segment. A clock faces sheet has a set of 6 clocks, each with a line and a stack of 2 vertical dots below, with no hands. A base ten materials sheet, is a 15 by 20 array of squares with a horizontal that divides the array into 2 equal parts and a vertical that divides the array into 2, 10 by 10 arrays on the left and 2, 5 by 10 arrays on the right. The sheet has directions as follows: Make two copies of this page, cut out the grid from each copy. Overlap the two grids and tape onto a blank sheet to form a 20 by 25 centimeter grid with 4 complete hundreds squares and 2 rows of 5 tens each. Use this as a master to make copies on card stock. An observation checklist has is a 5 by 14 array of rectangles with column headings, math topic, not there yet, on target, above and beyond and comments. the rectangle below math topic contains value student names.</p></details>
