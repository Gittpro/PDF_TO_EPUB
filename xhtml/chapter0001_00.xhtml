        <p>In his book <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_5"
                ><em>The World Is Flat</em> (2007)</a> Thomas Friedman discusses how globalization through technology
            has created the need for people to have lasting, adaptable skills so they can survive the ever-changing
            landscape of available jobs. He points out that in our digital world, lovers and doers of mathematics will
            always have career options and opportunities. However, no matter their career choice, given the extent to
            which our world relies on technology and the processing of massive amounts of information, all students need
            to develop skillsets that will allow them to be successful in our economy and society. Lynn Arthur Steen, a
            well-known mathematician and educator, stated, &#8220;As information becomes ever more quantitative and as
            society relies increasingly on computers and the data they produce, an innumerate citizen today is as
            vulnerable as the illiterate peasant of Gutenberg&#8217;s time&#8221; (1997, p. xv).</p>
        <p>To prepare students for an ever-changing world, for jobs that possibly do not even exist today, can&#8217;t
            we just pay more attention to the high school curriculum? Certainly what students learn in high school is
            important. However, a growing number of studies points to a strong association between early gains in
            mathematical ability and later academic achievement (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_4"
                >Claessens, Duncan, &amp; Engel, 2009</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_17"
                >Watts, Greg, Duncan, Siegler, &amp; Davis-Kean, 2014</a>). So we need to begin
            this preparation early in elementary school and continue to build on this foundation throughout the school
            years.</p>
