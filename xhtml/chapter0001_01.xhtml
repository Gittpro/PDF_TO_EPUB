        </header>
        <p>The changing world influences what should be taught in mathematics classrooms, even at the pre-K&#8211;2
            level. The dialogue on the best ways to prepare students to be successful in this changing world has
            involved mathematics educators, researchers, teachers, policymakers, and elected officials and has
            considered the many National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards documents, international
            assessments, and research.</p>
        <p>One of the influential documents that added to this dialogue is <em>Adding It Up</em> (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_9" >National Research Council [NRC], 2001</a>).
            Based on a review of the research on how children learn mathematics, this document identified the following
            five strands of mathematical proficiency that are seen as indicators of someone who understands (and can do)
            mathematics.</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p><em>Conceptual understanding:</em> Having a robust web of connections and relationships within and
                    between ideas, interpretations, and representations of mathematical concepts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Procedural fluency:</em> Being able to flexibly choose and accurately and efficiently perform an
                    appropriate strategy for a particular problem. For more on fluency, go to the NCTM website and
                    search for the 2014 Annual Meeting Webcast &#8220;President&#8217;s Session&#8211;Fluency . . .
                    It&#8217;s More Than Fast and Accurate.&#8221;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Strategic competence:</em> Being able to make sense of, represent, and determine solutions to
                    mathematical problems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Adaptive reasoning:</em> Being able to think about, explain, and justify one&#8217;s ideas using
                    mathematically sensible reasons coupled with the ability to shift strategies when needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Productive disposition:</em> Having an ingrained awareness that mathematics makes sense and is
                    useful, valuable, and rewarding along with the belief that one is capable of being successful in
                    learning and doing mathematics through hard work and perseverance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><a class="xref" href="chapter0001_01.xhtml#fig_1-1">Figure 1.1</a> illustrates the interrelated and
            interwoven nature of the strands of mathematical proficiency: As one strand develops it builds on and builds
            up other strands, resulting in a strengthened whole. As an example, consider the ineffective practice of
            teaching procedures in the absence of conceptual understanding. Often this approach yields a lack of
            retention and increased errors, rigid approaches, and inefficient strategy use. (<strong>Watch a related

            classrooms where these strands of proficiency are allowed to develop together, they are able to build a
            stronger understanding of both mathematical concepts and procedures.</p>

            <p>The strands of mathematical proficiency are labeled as follows. Adaptive reasoning: capacity for logical
                thought, reflection, explanation, and justification. Strategic competence: ability to formulate,
                represent, and solve mathematics problems. Conceptual understanding: comprehension of mathematical
                concepts, operations, and relations. Procedural fluency: skill in carrying out procedures flexibly,
                accurately, efficiently, and appropriately. Productive disposition: habitual inclination to see
                mathematics as sensible, useful and worthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and one&#8217;s own
                efficacy.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Numerous other reports and standards were developed as part of the effort to improve mathematics teaching and
            learning and prepare students for the ever-changing world. Among these was <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_505" >NCTM&#8217;s <em>Curriculum Focal
                Points</em> (2006)</a>, which offered guidance in developing a PreK&#8211;8 mathematics curriculum that was
            focused, provided depth, and explicitly showed connections between mathematical ideas. In turn, the
            <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (CCSS-M) (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_3"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>) and other state standards were developed that recognize the
            need for coherent and rigorous standards that promote college- and career-readiness.<span id="page3"
                class="pagebreak" title="3" />
        </p>
        <p>In particular, the CCSS-M articulates an overview of critical areas for each grade from K&#8211;8 to provide
            a coherent curriculum built around big mathematical ideas. At this time, more than 40 states; Washington,
            D.C.; four territories; and Department of Defense Schools have adopted the CCSS-M. A few states chose to not
            adopt these standards from the start and others are still deciding their level of participation or
            re-evaluating their own standards against CCSS-M. Nonetheless, this represents the largest shift of
            mathematics content in the United States in more than 100 years.</p>
        <p>This effort to develop standards that promote college- and career-readiness has resulted in attention to the
            <em>processes</em> of <em>doing</em> mathematics, not just the <em>content</em>. Notably, <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_6" >NCTM (2000)</a> identifies the process
            standards of problem solving, reasoning and proof, representation, communication, and connections as ways in
            which children acquire and use mathematical knowledge. Children engaged in the process of <em>problem
                solving</em> build mathematical knowledge and understanding by grappling with and solving genuine
            problems, as opposed to completing routine exercises. They use <em>reasoning and proof</em> to make sense of
            mathematical tasks and concepts and to develop, justify, and evaluate mathematical arguments and solutions.
            Children create and use <em>representations</em> (e.g., diagrams, graphs, symbols, and manipulatives) to
            reason through problems. They also engage in <em>communication</em> as they explain their ideas and
            reasoning verbally, in writing, and through representations. Children develop and use <em>connections</em>
            between mathematical ideas as they learn new mathematical concepts and procedures. They also build
            <em>connections</em> between mathematics and other disciplines by applying mathematics to real world
            situations. The process standards should not be regarded as separate content or strands in the mathematics
            curriculum; rather they are integral components of all mathematics teaching and learning. By engaging in
            these processes, children <em>learn</em> mathematics by <em>doing</em> mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>The CCSS-M also includes the Standards for Mathematical Practice (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_3"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>), which are ways in which children can develop and demonstrate
            a deep understanding of and capacity to do mathematics (see <a class="xref"
                href="appendix_a_00.xhtml">Appendix A</a>). Whether your state has adopted the CCSS, the eight Standards
            of Mathematical Practice are worthy of attention. These mathematical practices are based on the underlying
            frameworks of the NCTM process standards and the components of mathematical proficiency identified by the
            National Research Council&#8217;s document <em>Adding It Up</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_9"
                >NRC, 2001</a>). Like the NCTM process standards, these practices are not
            separate, but integral to all mathematics teaching and learning. Here we provide a brief discussion about
            each mathematical practice.</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p><em>Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</em> To make sense of problems, children
                    need to learn how to analyze the given information, parameters, and relationships in a problem so
                    that they can understand the situation and identify possible ways to solve it. Encourage younger
                    students to use concrete materials or bar diagrams to investigate and solve the problem. Once
                    children learn strategies for making sense of problems, encourage them to remain committed to
                    solving them. As they learn to monitor and assess their progress and change course as needed, they
                    will solve the problems they set out to solve!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Reason abstractly and quantitatively.</em> This practice involves children reasoning with
                    quantities and their relationships in problem situations. You can support children&#8217;s
                    development of this practice by helping them create representations that correspond to the meanings
                    of the quantities, units, and operations involved. When appropriate, children should also learn to
                    represent and manipulate the situation symbolically. Encourage children to find connections between
                    the abstract symbols and the representation that illustrates the quantities and their relationships.
                    For example, when children use drawings to show that 5 bears can be represented with 3 red bears and
                    2 yellow bears, encourage them to connect their representation to the number sentence <math

                            <mn>5</mn>
                            <mo>=</mo>
                            <mn>3</mn>

                        </mrow>
                    </math>. Ultimately, children should be able to move flexibly between the symbols and other
                    representations.<span id="page4" class="pagebreak" title="4" /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</em> This practice emphasizes
                    the importance of children using mathematical reasoning to justify their ideas and solutions,
                    including being able to recognize and use counterexamples. Encourage children to examine each
                    others&#8217; arguments to determine whether they make sense and to identify ways to clarify or
                    improve the arguments. This practice emphasizes that mathematics is based on reasoning and should be
                    examined in a community&#8212;not carried out in isolation. Tips for supporting children as they
                    learn to justify their ideas can be found in <a class="xref" href="chapter0002_00.xhtml">Chapter
                        2</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Model with mathematics.</em> This practice encourages children to use the mathematics they know
                    to describe, explain, and solve problems from a real-world context. For younger students this could
                    mean writing an addition or a subtraction equation to represent a given situation or using their
                    number sense to determine whether there are enough plates for all the children in their class. Be
                    sure to encourage children to determine whether their mathematical results make sense in the context
                    of the given situation. Note that this practice is different from <em>modeling mathematics</em>,
                    which involves using representations such as concrete materials to illustrate mathematical ideas
                    (e.g., base ten materials to show the 10-1 relationship in our number system).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Use appropriate tools strategically.</em> Children should become familiar with a variety of
                    problem-solving tools that can be used to solve a problem and they should learn to choose which ones
                    are most appropriate for a given situation. For example, second graders should experience using the
                    following tools for computation: pencil and paper, manipulatives, calculator, hundreds chart, and a
                    number line. Then in a situation when an estimate is needed for the sum of 23 and 52, some second
                    graders might consider paper and pencil, manipulatives, and a calculator as tools that would slow
                    down the process and would select a hundreds chart to quickly move from 50 down two rows (20 spaces)
                    to get to 70.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Attend to precision.</em> In communicating ideas to others, it is imperative that children learn
                    to be explicit about their reasoning. For example, they need to be clear about the meanings of the
                    operations and symbols they use, to indicate the units involved in a problem, and to clearly label
                    the diagrams they provide in their explanations. As children share their ideas, make this
                    expectation clear and ask clarifying questions that help make the details of their reasoning more
                    apparent. Teachers can further encourage children&#8217;s attention to precision by introducing,
                    highlighting, and encouraging the use of accurate mathematical terminology in explanations and
                    diagrams.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Look for and make use of structure.</em> Children who look for and recognize a pattern or
                    structure can experience a shift in their perspective or understanding. Therefore, set the
                    expectation that children will look for patterns and structure and help them reflect on their
                    significance. For example, look for opportunities to help children notice that the order in which
                    they add two numbers does not change the sum&#8212;they can add <math display="inline"

                    they will have a new understanding and the use of a powerful property of our number system, the
                    commutative property of addition.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.</em> Encourage children to step back and
                    reflect on any regularity that occurs to help them develop a general idea or method or to identify
                    shortcuts. For example, as children begin adding numbers together, they will encounter situations in
                    which zero is added to a number. Over time, help children reflect on the results of adding zero to
                    any number. Eventually they should be able to express that when they add or subtract zero to any
                    number, the number is unaffected.<span id="page5" class="pagebreak" title="5" /></p>

            <p>Research suggests that children, in particular girls, may tend to continue to use the same tools because
                they feel comfortable with the tools and are afraid to take risks (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_1"
                    >Ambrose, 2002</a>). Look for children who tend to use the same tool or
                strategy every time they work on tasks. Encourage all children to take risks and try new tools and
                strategies.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Note that the process standards are embedded in the mathematical practices. <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0001_01.xhtml#Tab_1-1">Table 1.1</a> shows one way to think about the relationship between
            the process standards and the eight mathematical practices. For example, ways to engage children in
            reasoning and proof involve the mathematical practices of reasoning abstractly and quantitatively,
            constructing viable arguments and critiquing others&#8217; reasoning, modeling with mathematics, and looking
            for and making use of structure. <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_2" >Bleiler,
                Baxter, Stephens, and Barlow (2015)</a> provide additional ideas to help teachers further their
            understanding of the eight mathematical practices. Children who learn to use these processes and practices
            of <em>doing</em> mathematics have a greater chance of becoming mathematically proficient.</p>

            <p>The mathematical practices labeled M P 1 to M P 8 are as follows. M P 1: make sense of problems and
                persevere in solving them. M P 2: Reason abstractly and quantitatively. M P 3: Construct viable
                arguments and critique the reasoning of others. M P 4: Model with mathematics. M P 5: Use appropriate
                tools strategically. M P 6: Attend to precision. M P 7: Look for and make use of structure. M P 8: Look
                for and express regularity in repeated reasoning. The process standards connect to the C C S S practices
                as follows: problem solving to M P 1, M P 2, M P 4, M P 5, M P 7, and M P 8. Reasoning and proof to M P
                2, M P 3, M P 4 and M P 7. Communication to M P 3 and M P 6. Representation to M P 1, M P 3, M P 4 and M
                P 5. Connections to M P 4, M P 7 and M P 8.</p>
