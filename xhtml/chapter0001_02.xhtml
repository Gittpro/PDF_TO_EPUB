            <h2 class="title">How Do Children Learn?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>As noted in <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_51" >NCTM&#8217;s (2014)</a>
            <em>Principles to Actions</em> document, research in mathematics education as well as in cognitive science
            supports the notion that learning is an active process in which each child, through personal experiences,
            interactions with others, and reflective thought, develops his or her own mathematical knowledge. The active
            nature required in developing the NCTM Process Standards and the CCSS-M Mathematical Practices is what makes
            them such powerful places for students to learn as they engage in doing mathematics.</p>
        <p>Two research-based theories about learning, constructivism and sociocultural theory, provide us with specific
            insights into the active nature of the learning process. Although one theory focuses on the individual
            learner and the other emphasizes the social and cultural aspects of the classroom, these theories are not
            competing and are actually compatible (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_10" >Norton
                &amp; D&#8217;Ambrosio, 2008</a>).</p>

            <h3 class="title" id="ch01-head-01">Constructivism</h3>
        </header>
        <p>At the heart of constructivism is the notion that learners are not blank slates but rather creators
            (constructors) of their own learning (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_11" >Piaget,
                1976</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_15" >von Glasersfeld, 1995</a>). All
            people, all <span id="page6" class="pagebreak" title="6" />of the time, construct or give meaning to things
            they experience or think about. Whether you are listening passively to a lecture or actively engaging in
            synthesizing findings in a project, your brain uses your existing knowledge to make sense of new
            information.</p>
        <p>Through reflective thought, people connect existing ideas to new information and in this way modify their
            existing knowledge to incorporate new ideas. Making these connections can happen in either of two
            ways&#8212;<em>assimilation</em> or <em>accommodation</em>. Assimilation occurs when a new concept
            &#8220;fits&#8221; with prior knowledge and the new information expands an existing mental network.
            Accommodation takes place when the new concept does not &#8220;fit&#8221; with the existing network, thus
            creating a cognitive conflict or state of confusion that causes what learning theorists call
            <em>disequilibrium</em>. As an example, consider what happens when children start learning about numbers and
            counting. They make sense of a number by counting a quantity of objects by ones. With larger numbers, such
            as two-digit numbers, they continue to use this approach to give meaning to the number (assimilation).
            Eventually, counting large amounts of objects becomes cumbersome and, at the same time, they are likely
            learning about grouping in tens. Over time they begin to view two-digit numbers differently&#8212;as groups
            of tens and ones&#8212;and they no longer have to count to give a number meaning (accommodation). It is
            through the struggle to resolve the disequilibrium that the brain modifies or replaces the existing
            knowledge so that the new concept fits and makes sense, resulting in a revision of thought and a deepening
            of the learner&#8217;s understanding.</p>
        <p>For an illustration of what it means to construct an idea, consider <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0001_02.xhtml#fig_1-2">Figure 1.2</a>. The blue and red dots represent ideas, and the lines
            joining the ideas represent the logical connections or relationships that develop between ideas. The red dot
            is an emerging idea, one that is being constructed. Whatever existing ideas (blue dots) are used in the
            construction are connected to the new idea (red dot) because those are the ideas that give meaning to the
            new idea. The more existing ideas that are used to give meaning to the new one, the more connections will be
            made.</p>

        <p>Each child&#8217;s unique collection of ideas is connected in different ways. Some ideas are well understood
            and well formed (i.e., connected), others less so as they evolve. Children&#8217;s experiences help them
            develop connections and ideas about whatever they are learning.</p>
