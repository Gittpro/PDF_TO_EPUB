</header>
<p>Like constructivism, sociocultural theory not only positions the learner as actively engaged in seeking meaning during the learning process, but it also suggests that the learner can be assisted by working with others who are &#8220;more knowledgeable.&#8221; Sociocultural theory proposes that learners have their own zone of proximal development, which is a range of knowledge that may be out of reach for individuals to learn on their own but is accessible if learners have the support of peers or more knowledgeable others (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_16" >Vygotsky, 1978</a>). For example, when young children are learning to measure length, they do not necessarily recognize the significance of placing measurement units end to end. As children measure objects, they may leave gaps between units or overlap units. A more knowledgeable person (a peer or teacher) can draw their attention to this critical idea in measurement.</p>
<p>The most effective learning for any given child occurs when classroom activities are within his or her zone of proximal development. Targeting that zone helps teachers provide children with the right amount of challenge, while avoiding boredom on the one hand and anxiety on the other when the challenge is beyond the child&#8217;s current capability. Consequently, classroom discussions based on children&#8217;s own ideas and solutions are absolutely crucial to their learning (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_19" >Wood &amp; Turner-Vorbeck, 2001</a>).</p>
