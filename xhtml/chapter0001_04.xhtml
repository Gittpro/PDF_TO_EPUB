</header>
<p>Teachers generally agree that teaching for understanding is a good thing. But what do we mean by <em>understanding</em>? Understanding is being able to flexibly think about and use a topic or concept. It goes beyond knowing; it is more than a collection of information, facts, or data. It is more than being able to follow steps in a procedure. One hallmark of mathematical understanding is a student&#8217;s ability to justify why a given mathematical claim or answer is true or why a mathematical rule makes sense (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_3" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). Although children might <em>know</em> their basic addition and subtraction facts and be able to give you quick answers to questions about these facts, they might not <em>understand,</em> for example, the different meanings of subtraction. They might not be able to justify how they know an answer is correct or provide an example of when it would make sense to use a particular basic fact. These tasks go beyond simply knowing mathematical facts and procedures. Understanding must be a primary goal for all of the mathematics you teach.</p>
<p>Understanding exists along a continuum (<a class="xref" href="chapter0001_04.xhtml#fig_1-3">Figure 1.3</a>) from an instrumental understanding&#8212;doing or knowing something without meaning&#8212;to a relational understanding&#8212;knowing what to do and why. These two terms were introduced by Richard Skemp in 1978 and continue to provide an important distinction about what is important for children to know about mathematics. Instrumental understanding, at the left end of the continuum, shows that ideas (e.g., concepts and procedures) are learned, but in isolation (or nearly so) to other ideas. Here you find ideas that have been memorized. Due to their isolation, poorly understood ideas are easily forgotten and are unlikely to be useful for constructing new ideas. At the right end of the continuum is relational understanding. Relational understanding means that each new concept or procedure (red dot) is not only learned, but is also connected to many existing ideas (blue dots), so there is a rich set of connections.</p>

<p>A diagram of the continuum of understanding has two ovals and a horizontal line with an arrow on each end which extends behind the ovals. The arrow left of the ovals, extends to instrumental understanding and the arrow right of the ovals extends to relational understanding. Both ovals have a center point and scattered points. The left oval has the center point connected to one scattered point and the right oval has the center point connected by 4 curves to 4 scattered points. The scattered points in the right oval are more connected to each other.</p>
</details>
<p>The common notion of quickly &#8220;covering the material&#8221; and moving on is problematic when trying to help children develop relational understanding. Relational understanding is an end goal&#8212;that is, it is developed over time by incorporating active learning through the process standards and mathematical practices and striving toward mathematical proficiency. Therefore, relational understanding must be a goal for both daily and long-term instruction.</p>

<p>To explore the notion of understanding further, let&#8217;s look into a learner-centered second-grade classroom. In learner-centered classrooms, teachers begin <em>where the children are</em>&#8212;with the <em>children&#8217;s</em> ideas. Children are allowed to solve problems or to approach tasks in ways that make sense to them. They develop a robust understanding of mathematics because they are the ones who explain, provide evidence or justification, find or create examples, generalize, analyze, make predictions, apply concepts, represent ideas in different ways, and articulate connections or relationships between the given topic and other ideas.<span id="page8" class="pagebreak" title="8" /></p>
<p>In this particular second-grade classroom, the children have done numerous activities with the hundreds chart and an open number line. They have counted collections of objects and made many measurements of things in the room. In their counting and measuring, they often count groups of objects instead of counting by ones. Counting by tens has become a popular method for most, but not all, children. The class has taken big numbers apart in different ways to emphasize relationships between numbers and place value. In many of these activities, the children have used combinations of tens to make numbers. The children in the class have not been taught the typical procedures for addition or subtraction.</p>
<p>The teacher sets the following instructional objectives for the students:</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li><p>Use number relationships (e.g., place-value ideas, such as 36 is 3 groups of 10 and 6 ones; 36 is 4 away from 40; etc.) to add two-digit numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply flexible methods of addition.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As is often the case, this class begins with a story problem and the children set to work.</p>

<p>When Carla was at the zoo, she saw the monkeys eating bananas. She asked the zookeeper how many bananas the monkeys usually ate in one day. The zookeeper said that yesterday they ate 36 bananas but today they ate only 25 bananas. How many bananas did the monkeys eat in those two days?</p>

Then check to see if your ways are alike or different from those that follow.</p>

<p>Some children use counters and count by ones. Some use the hundreds chart or base-ten models and others use mental strategies or an open number line. All are expected to use words and numbers and, if they wish, drawings to show what they did and how they thought about the problem. After about 20 minutes of moving about the room, observing and listening to the children&#8217;s ideas, the teacher begins a discussion by having specific children share their ideas. As the children report, the teacher records their ideas on the board so everyone can see them. Sometimes the teacher asks questions to help clarify ideas but makes no evaluative comments. The teacher asks the children who are listening if they understand or have any questions to ask the presenters. The following solution strategies are common in classrooms where children are regularly asked to generate their own approaches.</p>
<ul class="ul_none">
<li><p><strong>Avery:</strong> I know that 25 and 25 is 50&#8212;like two quarters. And 35 is ten more so that is 60. And then one more is 61.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teacher:</strong> What do you mean when you say &#8220;35 is ten more&#8221;?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avery:</strong> Well, I used 25 of the 36 and 25 and ten more is 35.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sasha:</strong> I did 30 and 20 is 50 and then <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render15.png" alttext="6 plus 5" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation"><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow></math> more.

<li><p><strong>Juan:</strong> I counted on using the hundreds chart. I started at 36 and then I had to go 20 from there and so that was 46 and then 56. And then I went five more: 57, 58, 59, 60, 61.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I used an open number to help me. I started at 36 and went up 4 to 40. Then I went up a jump of 20 and then one more to get to 61. (<a class="xref" href="chapter0001_04.xhtml#fig_1-4">Figure 1.4</a>)</p>

<p>What ideas did you learn from those shared in this example? Try using some of these new ideas to find the sum of 64 and 27.</p>
</aside>
<p>This vignette illustrates that when children are encouraged to solve a problem in their own way (using their own particular set of blue dots or ideas), they are able to make sense of their solution strategies and explain their reasoning. This is evidence of their development of mathematical proficiency.</p>
<p>During the discussions in classes such as this one, ideas continue to grow. The children may hear and immediately understand a clever strategy that they could have used but that did not occur to them. Others may begin to create new ideas that build from thinking about their classmates&#8217; strategies. Some in the class may hear excellent ideas from their peers that do not make sense to them. These children are simply not ready or do not have the prerequisite concepts (blue dots) to understand these new ideas. On subsequent days there will be similar opportunities for all children to grow at their own pace based on what they already understand.</p>
