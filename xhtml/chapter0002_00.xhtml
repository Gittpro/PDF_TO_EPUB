        <p>Preparing children to be quantitatively literate so they can function in today&#8217;s increasingly complex
            world will allow them to think more logically, work flexibly with numbers, analyze evidence, and communicate
            their ideas to others effectively. Unfortunately, as Elizabeth Green points out in her article <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_34" ><em>Why Do
                Americans Stink at Math?</em> (2014, February)</a>, many Americans of all ages demonstrate quantitative
            deficiencies. Green argues that to overcome these quantitative deficiencies we must change our view of
            mathematics from rules to be memorized to sense-making ways of looking at the world around us. Teaching
            mathematics through problem solving is a method of teaching mathematics that supports children in developing
            the kinds of skills and understanding that will serve them well in today&#8217;s world and beyond. In this
            chapter, we focus on how to teach through problem solving, including how to select worthwhile tasks and
            facilitate student engagement in those tasks.</p>
