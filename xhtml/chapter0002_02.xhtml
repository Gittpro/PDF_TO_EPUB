            <h2 class="title">Mathematics Teaching Practices for Teaching <em>through</em> Problem Solving</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Teaching <em>through</em> problem solving requires a paradigm shift, which means that teachers are doing more
            than just tweaking a few things about their teaching; they are changing their philosophy about how they
            think children learn best and how they can best help them learn. At first glance, it may seem that the
            teacher&#8217;s role is less demanding because the children are doing the mathematics, but the
            teacher&#8217;s role is actually more demanding in such classrooms.</p>
        <p>Classrooms where children are engaging with and making sense of mathematics through inquiry do not happen by
            accident&#8212;they happen because the teacher uses practices and establishes expectations that encourage
            risk taking, reasoning, the generation and sharing of ideas, and so forth. <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0002_02.xhtml#Tab_2-1">Table 2.1</a> lists eight research-informed, high-leverage teaching
            practices, identified in <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_51" >NCTM&#8217;s
                (2014)</a> <em>Principles to Actions</em>, that support children to develop a robust understanding of
            mathematics. These teaching practices are designed to address issues of access and equity so that all
            children can succeed in learning mathematics. We will refer back to these teaching practices throughout this
            chapter as we consider how to teach mathematics <em>through</em> problem solving.</p>
