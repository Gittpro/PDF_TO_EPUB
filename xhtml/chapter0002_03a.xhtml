</header>
<p>Your children will likely have a wide range of experiences in mathematics, so it is important to use problems that have multiple entry points, meaning that the problems have varying degrees of challenge or can be approached in a variety of ways. Having multiple entry points can help accommodate the diversity of learners in your classroom because children are encouraged to use a strategy that makes sense to them instead of using a predetermined strategy that they may or may not be ready to use successfully. Having a choice of strategies can also lower the anxiety of children, particularly English Language Learners (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_50" >Murrey, 2008</a>). Some children may initially use less efficient approaches, such as guess and check or counting, but they will develop more advanced strategies through effective questioning by the teacher and by reflecting on other children&#8217;s approaches. For example, for the task of finding three numbers whose sum is 35, one child may use a guess-and-check approach, listing three numbers and adding them to see if their sum is 35, whereas another child may use a more systematic approach, such as splitting 35 into 30 and 5 and then splitting 30 or 5 into two addends. Still other children may choose two numbers they estimate will sum to an amount less than 35 and then subtract that sum from 35 to find the third number. Asking children to compare these approaches, and in particular to identify advantages and disadvantages of each, can help children move toward more advanced strategies.</p>
<p>Tasks should also have multiple exit points, or various ways that children can express solutions that reveal a range of mathematical sophistication. For example, children might draw a diagram, write an equation, use manipulatives, or act out a problem to demonstrate their understanding. Even though children might initially select an inefficient or less sophisticated approach, as ideas are exchanged during and after the problem is solved, children will have opportunities to understand and try other approaches. As they discuss ideas, draw visuals, use manipulatives, or act out a problem, defend their strategy, critique the reasoning of others, and write about their reasoning, they engage in higher-level thinking. As an added bonus, the teacher is also able to gather useful formative assessment data about children&#8217;s mathematical understanding.</p>
<p>Consider the opportunities for multiple entry and exit points in the following tasks. Both tasks use an everyday classroom routine to provide children an opportunity to work on skills related to counting.<span id="page21" class="pagebreak" title="21" /></p>

<p>To what degree do these tasks offer opportunities for multiple entry and exit points?</p>
</aside>
<p>If the snacks are readily available, as in the first task, the children will most likely pass them out to see if there are enough snacks and will miss any opportunity to think deeply about the situation. The second task offers more opportunity for children to engage with the task in a variety of ways, which also offers the teacher more information about each child&#8217;s level of understanding. For example, how children organize their count of the pictured snacks is informative. Do they start at the top and count across the rows? Or do they haphazardly count and miss or double-count? Do they count by ones? Do they count from one or do they count on from a recognized amount? Once they know how many snacks are on the sheet, can they automatically state whether there are enough snacks for everyone, or do they need to represent each child in the class, say, with a counter, and match a counter with a pictured snack? Clearly, the second task offers many more opportunities for all children to engage in the task in a variety of ways.</p>
