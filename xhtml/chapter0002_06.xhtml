</header>
<p>Sometimes children may not know what to do with a problem you pose, no matter how many hints and suggestions you offer. Do not give in to the temptation to &#8220;tell them.&#8221; When you sense that a task is not moving forward, don&#8217;t spend days just hoping that something wonderful may happen. You may need to regroup and offer children a simpler but related task that gets them prepared for the one that proved too difficult. If that does not work, set it aside for the moment. Ask yourself why it didn&#8217;t work well. Did the children have the prior knowledge they needed? Was the task too advanced? Consider what might be a way to step back or step forward in the content in order to support and challenge the class. Nonetheless, trust that teaching mathematics <em>through</em> problem solving offers children the productive struggle that will allow them to develop understanding and become mathematically proficient.</p>
