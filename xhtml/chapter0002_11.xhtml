        <p>One of the teaching practices identified in<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_51"
                    > <em>Principles to Actions</em> (2014)</a> is <em>use and connect
                mathematical representations.</em> The fact that representations made the cut on this short list should
            give you some sense of its importance in teaching for relational understanding.</p>

            <h3 class="title" id="ch02-head-10">Build a Web of Representations</h3>
        </header>
        <p><span id="page30" class="pagebreak" title="30" />Different representations can illuminate different aspects of a mathematical idea. So to help children build
            their understanding, they should be encouraged to use, explore, and make connections among multiple
            representations. <a class="xref" href="chapter0002_11.xhtml#fig_2-1">Figure 2.1</a> provides a general Web
            of Representations that can be applied to any mathematical concept and illustrates the various ways
            mathematical ideas can be represented. Children who have difficulty translating a concept from one
            representation to another also have difficulty solving problems and understanding computations (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_29" >Clement, 2004</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_46" >Lesh, Cramer, Doerr, Post, &amp; Zawojewski,
                2003</a>). Strengthening children&#8217;s ability to move between and among representations improves
            their understanding and retention of ideas. For any topic you teach, you can give children the <a
                href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Translation_Task_Template_Grades_Pre-K&#8211;2.pdf"
                class="ulink">Translation Task</a> to complete. (More information is given regarding the
            use of the Translation Task in <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_00.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, Creating
            Assessments for Learning.) Fill out one box and ask children to insert the other representations, or you can
            invite a group to work on all four representations for a given topic (e.g., addition).</p>

                    understanding can be demonstrated through these different representations of mathematical ideas.
                    Translations between each can help children develop new concepts and demonstrate a richer
                    understanding.</h3>

            <p>7 boxes are in a circle, each box containing a way to demonstrate mathematical understanding. The boxes
                are each connected to the six other boxes by lines to form a web. Clockwise, the boxes are as follows.
                Explain meaning in words. Illustrate with physical tools or manipulatives. Write using symbols. Draw a
                diagram. Display data in a table. Create a graph. Give a context, or real-life example.</p>
