</header>
<p>A <em>tool</em> is any object, picture, or drawing that can be used to explore a concept. CCSS-M includes calculators and manipulatives as tools for doing mathematics (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_27" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). Manipulatives are physical objects that children and teachers can use to illustrate and explore mathematical concepts. Choices for manipulatives (including virtual manipulatives) are plentiful&#8212;from common objects such as lima beans to commercially produced materials such as Pattern Blocks. A range of manipulatives (e.g., geoboards, base-ten blocks, spinners, number lines) are available in a virtual format, for example, on the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives (NLVM) website and the NCTM Illuminations website.<span id="page31" class="pagebreak" title="31" /></p>
<p>Some research suggests benefits to incorporating both physical and virtual manipulatives in instruction (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_41" >Hunt, Nipper, &amp; Nash, 2011</a>). Physical manipulatives can build the foundation for conceptual understanding while subsequent use of virtual manipulatives can assist learners in bridging to the abstract. For example, at some websites, such as the NLVM website, a displayed number representing the computerized base-ten blocks changes as the base-ten blocks are modified so that children can see the corresponding results of the changed manipulatives on the numbers.</p>
<p>Note that a tool does not &#8220;illustrate&#8221; a concept. While the tool is used to visualize a mathematical concept, an individual has to impose the mathematical relationship on the object (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_64" >Suh, 2007b</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_65" >Thompson, 1994</a>). In other words, the manipulative is not the concept but offers a testing ground for emerging ideas. <a class="xref" href="chapter0002_12.xhtml#fig_2-2">Figure 2.2</a> shows three blocks commonly used to represent ones, tens, and hundreds. If a child is able to identify the rod as the &#8220;ten&#8221; piece and the large square block as the &#8220;hundred&#8221; piece, does this mean he has constructed the concepts of ten and hundred? No, all you know for sure is that he has learned the names typically assigned to the manipulatives. The mathematical concept of a ten is that one ten is the same as ten ones. This concept is the relationship between the rod and the small cube. This relationship called &#8220;ten&#8221; must be created by children in their own minds and imposed on the manipulative or the model used to represent the concept. For a child who does not yet understand the relationship, the model does not illustrate the concept for that individual. Over time, discussions that explicitly focus on the mathematical concepts can help children make the connections between manipulatives and related concepts. When you are considering using particular tools, take time yourself to try to separate the physical tool from the relationship that you must impose on the tool in order to &#8220;see&#8221; the concept. This insight will help you support your children as they work with the given tool.</p>

<p>A set of base ten blocks has a single block, a rod of ten connected blocks, and a ten-by-ten array of 100 connected blocks, which are models with corresponding names, one, ten and hundred. Two relationships between the blocks are shown. Ten &#8220;ones&#8221; is the same as one &#8220;ten&#8221;, shown by a double-headed arrow between the single block and the row of ten. 10 &#8220;tens&#8221; is the same as one &#8220;hundred&#8221;, shown by a double-headed arrow between the row of ten blocks and the group of 100 blocks.</p>

<p>It is incorrect to say that a manipulative or object &#8220;illustrates&#8221; or shows a concept. Manipulatives can help children visualize the relationships and talk about them, but what they see are the manipulatives, not concepts.</p>
</aside>
<p>Although tools can be used to support the development of relational understanding, used ineffectively, they do not accomplish this goal. The most widespread misuse of manipulatives occurs when teachers tell children, &#8220;Do exactly as I do.&#8221; There is a natural temptation to get out the materials and show children exactly <em>how to use them</em>. Children mimic the teacher&#8217;s directions, and it may even look as if they understand, but they could be just following what they see. A rote procedure with a manipulative is still just that, a rote procedure. The converse is to provide no focus or purpose for using the tools. Neither approach promotes thinking or aids in the development of concepts (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_21" >Ball, 1992</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_61" >Stein &amp; Bovalino, 2001</a>).</p>
<p>Drawings are another option for children to represent and illustrate mathematical concepts and are important for a number of reasons. First, when children draw, you learn more about what they do or do not understand. For example, if children show <sup>1</sup>&#160;/<sub>2</sub> with their own drawings, you can observe whether they understand that each half must be the same size. Second, manipulatives can sometimes restrict how children can model a problem, whereas a drawing allows children to use any strategy they want. Plus, because children enter school with a limited ability to express their ideas in writing, a drawing may be the most appropriate way for them to express their ideas. <a class="xref" href="chapter0002_12.xhtml#fig_2-3">Figure 2.3</a> shows an example of one kindergartner&#8217;s solution for ways to <span id="page32" class="pagebreak" title="32" />make 5. Children should eventually be encouraged to connect their drawings to symbols, but they should not be forced to do so too soon. Some children will take longer than others to make this connection and that difference should be honored. Look for opportunities to use children&#8217;s representations during classroom discussions to help them make sense of the more abstract mathematical symbols. Furthermore, as children use different representations to solve a problem, have them compare and contrast the various ways to facilitate making connections.</p>

<p>For the question, &#8220;how many ways can five people be on two stories of a house?&#8221;, a kindergartener draws a sketch of five house shapes that are divided into two parts horizontally that each contain 5 circles. The first has 3 circles above and 2 circles below the horizontal. The second has 4 circles above and 1 circle below the horizontal. The third has 2 circles above and 3 circles below the horizontal. The fourth has 1 circle above and 4 circles below the horizontal. The fifth has 2 circles above and 3 circles below the horizontal.</p>
