<h3 class="title" id="ch03-head-02">Checklists</h3>
</header>
<p>To help focus your attention, a checklist with several specific processes, mathematical practices, or content objectives can be devised (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_02.xhtml#fig_3-1">Figure 3.1</a>). As you can see there is a place for comments that should concentrate on big ideas and conceptual understanding. For example you will probably find a note such as &#8220;is beginning to see how multiplication facts can be related, such as using <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render30.png" alttext="6 plus 6" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation"><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow></math> to think about <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render31.png" alttext="6 plus 16" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation"><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>16</mn></mrow></math>&#8221; more useful than &#8220;knows easy addition facts but not hard ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>The checklist has a space for student name at the top, and is divided below into an upper and lower section, for place value and mathematical practices. Place value is further divided into rows of 5 skills: skip counts by tens, skip counts by hundreds, understands one hundred equals ten tens, reads and writes numbers to one thousand, and compares three-digit numbers. Mathematical practices is further divided into rows for 3 skills: makes sense of problems and perseveres, models with mathematics and uses appropriate tools. Each row is divided into 4 columns: not there yet, on target, above and beyond, and comments. In the example given, for Sharon V, check marks are placed in the, not there yet, column for understands 100 equals ten tens, reads and writes numbers to 1000, and models with mathematics. The remaining skills have check marks in the, on target, column. Comments on the form, by row, are as follows. Skip counts by hundreds: took out hundreds pieces while skip counting. Compares three-digit numbers: showing greater reasonableness. Makes sense of problems and perseveres: stated problem in own words. Models with mathematics: reluctant to use abstract models.</p>

<p>Another Observation Checklist involves listing all children in a class on one to three pages (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_02.xhtml#fig_3-2">Figure 3.2</a>). Across the top of the page are specific abilities or common misconceptions to look for, possibly based on learning progressions. Pluses and minuses, checks, or codes can be entered in the grid. A full-class checklist is more likely to be used for long-term objectives such as problem-solving processes, strategic use of representations or tools, and such skill areas as basic fact fluency or computational estimation. Dating entries or noting specifics about observed performance is also helpful.</p>

<p>The class observation checklist has 5 columns, from left to right as follows. The first column has the topic and the heading, names; the second column reads, not there yet, followed by, on target, above and beyond, and comments. The checklist has a list of student names on the left with each name in its own row. The topic in this example is, addition with sums to 20. Definitions for the skill categories are written in as follows: not there yet = can&#8217;t do mentally; on target = has at least one strategy; above and beyond = uses different methods with different numbers. Each student has check marks in one or more columns with corresponding dates and brief comments in the last column, including the following: difficulty with addends of 8 and 9; flexible approaches used; count up and over ten; beginning to look for ways to make ten; and, use a counting on strategy from the highest addend.</p>
