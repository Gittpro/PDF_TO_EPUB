<p>Probing children&#8217;s thinking through questioning can provide better data and more insights to inform instructional next steps. As you circulate around the classroom to observe and evaluate children&#8217;s understanding, your use of questions is one of the <span id="page41" class="pagebreak" title="41" />most important ways to formatively assess in each lesson phase. Have <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Question_Probes.pdf" class="ulink">Question Probes</a> on a tablet or in print as you move about the classroom to prompt and probe children&#8217;s thinking.</p>
<p>To make sure you are asking critical thinking questions you may want to consider videotaping yourself and having a friend score how many high-level or how many recall questions you are asking. Use a matrix such as the Cognitive Rigor Matrix (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_92" >Simpson, Mokalled, Ellenburg, &amp; Che, 2014/2015</a>) which is a blend of Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy and Webb&#8217;s Depth of Knowledge (2002) for additional information.</p>
<p>Getting children used to responding to these questions (as well as accustomed to asking questions about their thinking and the thinking of others) helps prepare them for the more intensive questioning used in interviews.</p>
