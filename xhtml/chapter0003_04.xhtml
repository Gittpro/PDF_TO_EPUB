        <p>&#8220;An assessment system designed to help steer the instruction system must give good information about
            direction as well as distance to travel. A system that keeps telling us we are not there yet is like a kid
            in the back seat whining &#8216;are we there yet?&#8217; &#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_77"
                >Daro et al., 2011</a>, p. 51). Interviews, particularly diagnostic interviews,
            are means of getting in-depth information about a child&#8217;s knowledge of concepts and strategy use to
            provide needed navigation. The diagnostic interview is usually a one-on-one investigation of a child&#8217;s
            thinking about a particular concept, process, or mathematical practice that lasts from three to ten minutes.
            The challenge of diagnostic interviews is that they are assessment opportunities, not teaching
            opportunities, making it hard to watch children make errors and not respond immediately. The interviews are
            used to listen to children&#8217;s descriptions of their strategies and probe their understanding with the
            purpose of discovering both strengths and gaps.</p>
        <p>To start, select a problem that matches an essential understanding for the topic children are studying and
            have paper, pencils, and a variety of materials available (particularly manipulatives used during previous
            instruction). Also, be ready to jot down notes about emerging understandings, common methods you expect
            children to use, or common misunderstandings that you anticipate. Then ask the child to solve the problem
            and make sure the child verbalizes his or her thinking at several points. Encourage multiple representations
            by asking <span id="page42" class="pagebreak" title="42" />the child to demonstrate his or her thinking
            using materials or drawings. <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_78" >Fennell, Kobett,
                and Wray call this the &#8220;show me&#8221; approach (2015</a>, p. 56).</p>

            <p>These interviews can be time intensive but they have the potential to provide information that you simply
                cannot get in any other way. So how can you accomplish this? Think of these interviews as tools to be
                used for only a few children at a time, not for every child in the class. Briefly interview a single
                child while others work on a task or are in learning centers. Some teachers work with one child at an
                interactive whiteboard and record the whole conversation, any written work, or use of virtual
                manipulatives. Other times a paraprofessional or student teacher can interview.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Sometimes children self-correct a mistake but, more frequently, you can unearth a child&#8217;s
            misunderstanding or reveal what strategies are mastered. When you focus on exploring common errors and
            pitfalls, you can then build greater sophistication in children&#8217;s conceptual understanding (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_74" >Bray &amp; Santagata, 2014</a>). Primary
            diagnostic interviews might include tasks such as counting a group of objects and writing down the number on
            paper, or asking children to solve a missing addend problem such as <math display="inline"

        <p>After examining hundreds of research studies, <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_80"
                >Hattie (2009)</a> found that feedback that teachers received from children on
            what they knew and did not know was critical in improving children&#8217;s performance. That is precisely
            what diagnostic interviews are designed to do! For example, are you sure that your children have a good
            understanding of place value, or are they just doing subtraction exercises according to rote procedures?
            Remediation will be more successful if you can pinpoint why a child is having difficulty before you try to
            fix the problem.</p>
        <p>Let&#8217;s look at an actual example of a diagnostic interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dix was working with a child who was displaying difficulty with calculating subtraction problems. To get
            the child to reveal where her thinking was in terms of what she understood and where some gaps might be, Mr.
            Dix planned a diagnostic interview. Using an adaptation of a task (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_89"
                >Philipp, Cabral, &amp; Schappell, 2012</a>), he showed the child a problem
            (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_04.xhtml#fig_3-3">Figure 3.3</a>) and asked her to talk about her
            thinking as she answered. The child said, &#8220;Four from zero is four and five from eight is three, so my
            answer is 34.&#8221; Although base-ten materials were on the table, they went untouched. As is necessary in
            these interviews, Mr. Dix resisted the temptation to immediately correct the child, and instead probed
            further by asking the child if she could show the same problem using base-ten materials. Showing fluency
            with the values of base-ten materials, the child took out correct amounts and placed them on the table. She
            used the 54 that she took out as a reference and touched the other materials (in the group of 80) to show
            how many she would be taking away. This time she arrived at the answer 26. The confusion was evident in her
            expression, but when asked which answer was correct, she pointed back to her original calculation. She even
            redid the algorithm and repeated her mistaken &#8220;four from zero is four.&#8221; The child quietly
            pondered and then pointed again to the answer of 34.</p>

            <img class="fx-lightbox preventTap"

                src="../images/fig03-03.png"></img>
        </figure>
        <p>Although this interview revealed that the child had a good grasp of the value of the base-ten materials, it
            also revealed that the child was not seeing the need to regroup and may not fully understand place-value
            concepts. The child also referred to the numbers in the tens column as &#8220;8&#8221; and &#8220;5&#8221;
            rather than 80 and 50. Notice that the teacher explicitly linked the assessment to classroom instruction
            through the use of concrete materials. This connection provided a way for the child to think about the
            number rather than just the individual digits. In addition, the cognitive dissonance caused by getting two
            different numerical outcomes, one responding to the procedure alone and the other using the corresponding
            concrete materials, enabled more connected ideas to emerge. Planning could then begin for future instruction
            based on actual evidence from the child.<span id="page43" class="pagebreak" title="43" /></p>
        <p>There is no one right way to plan or structure a diagnostic interview. In fact, flexibility is a key
            ingredient. You should, however, have an overall plan that includes an easier task and a more challenging
            task in case you have misjudged your starting point. Also, did you notice that Mr. Dix had appropriate
            instructional materials ready for the child to use? Be sure you have materials available that have potential
            to provide insight into children&#8217;s understanding. Also be prepared to probe children&#8217;s thinking
            with question like these:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Can you explain what you just did?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>How would you explain this to your younger sister?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Can you draw a picture to help you think about this problem?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What does this [point to something on the paper] stand for?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Why did you solve it that way?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Can you show me what you are thinking with [materials such as counters, hundreds chart, and so on]?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Why do you think you got two different answers? Which one do you think is correct?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In each case, it is important to explore whether children can use models to connect actions to what he or she
            wrote or explained earlier.</p>
        <p>Consider the following suggestions as you implement your diagnostic interview:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p><em>Avoid revealing whether the child&#8217;s answer is right or wrong.</em> Often facial
                    expressions, tone of voice, or body language can give a child clues. Instead, use a response such as
                    &#8220;Can you tell me more?&#8221; or &#8220;I think I know what you are thinking.&#8221;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Wait silently for the child to give an answer.</em> Give ample time to allow a child to think and
                    respond. Only then should you move to rephrasing questions or probing for a better understanding of
                    a child&#8217;s thoughts. After the child gives a response (whether it is accurate or not), wait
                    again! This second wait time is even more important because it encourages the child to elaborate on
                    initial thoughts and provide more information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Avoid interjecting clues or teaching.</em> The temptation to interrupt is sometimes overwhelming.
                    Watch and listen. Your goal is to use the interview not to teach but to find out where the child is
                    in terms of conceptual understanding and procedural fluency.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Give opportunities for children to share their thinking without interruption.</em> Encourage
                    children to use their own words and ways of writing things down. Correcting language or spelling
                    words can sidetrack the flow of children&#8217;s explanations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The benefits of diagnostic interviews become evident as you plan instruction that capitalizes on
            children&#8217;s strengths while recognizing possible weaknesses and confusion. Also, unlike large-scale
            testing, you can always ask another question to find out more when the child is taking an incorrect or
            unexpected path. You may also discuss results of interviews with colleagues to gain shared insights (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_94" >Stephan, McManus, &amp; Dehlinger, 2014</a>).
            These insights are invaluable in moving children to mathematical proficiency, as there is perhaps no better
            method for developing instruction that supports children&#8217;s understanding than having them explain
            their thinking and a team of teachers sharing a conversation about evidence.</p>
