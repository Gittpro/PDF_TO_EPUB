        </header>
        <p>One important assessment option is what we refer to as a <em>translation task.</em> Using four possible
            representations for concepts (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0002_12.xhtml#fig_2-3">Figure 2.3</a>),
            children are asked to demonstrate understanding using words, models/materials, and numbers for a single
            problem. As children move between these representations, there is a better chance that a concept will be
            formed correctly and integrated into a rich web of ideas.</p>
        <p>So what is a good way of structuring a translation task? With use of a template based on a format for
            assessing concept mastery from <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_79" >Frayer,
                Fredrick, and Klausmeier (1969)</a> (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_06.xhtml#fig_3-4">Figure
                3.4</a>) and the <a
                    href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Translation_Task_Template_Grades_Pre-K&#8211;2.pdf"
                    class="ulink">Translation Task Template</a>, you can give children a computational equation
            and ask them to:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Tell a story or write a word problem to match an equation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Illustrate the equation with materials or drawings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Given a story situation, write an equation or draw a picture.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In particular, children&#8217;s ability to communicate how they solved a problem is critical for
            open-response questions on many summative assessments (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_87"
                >Parker &amp; Breyfogle, 2011</a>).</p>
        <p>Translation tasks can be used for whole-class lessons or for individual or small-group diagnosis. For
            example, second-grade children may be given an equation such as <math display="inline"
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render34.png" alttext="36 plus 49 equals ?"
                altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation">
                <mrow>
                    <mn>36</mn>
                    <mo>+</mo>
                    <mn>49</mn>
                    <mo>=</mo>
                    <mtext>?</mtext>
                </mrow>
            </math> (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_06.xhtml#fig_3-4">Figure 3.4</a>). The task could be for
            children to draw a model, say, of base ten-materials in &#8220;Manipulatives/Illustration&#8221; (younger
            children can show a manipulative), describe a real-world situation in which that addition is used in
            &#8220;Real-World Story or Word Problems,&#8221; and explain to another person in writing (or scripted or
            audio recorded for younger children) how they solved the addition in the fourth area labeled &#8220;Explain
            Your Thinking.&#8221; Think about using translation tasks when you want to find out more about a
            child&#8217;s ability to represent ideas and explain how these representations are connected. Depending on
            the concept, the translation task can start in a different section of the template.</p>
        <p>Consider these possible starters.</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Start with this problem in the section &#8220;Real-World Story or Word Problem&#8221;:</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="sidenote-3">
            <p>Jack was at the pet store. A group of puppies came over and sat on Jack&#8217;s lap. Two of the puppies
                jumped off. Now Jack has three puppies on his lap. How many puppies did Jack have on his lap in the
                beginning?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Then children create the equation that corresponds with the problem, make a matching drawing, and explain how
            they came to their answer.<span id="page46" class="pagebreak" title="46" /></p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>In the &#8220;Manipulatives/Illustration&#8221; section show two groups of coins in two circles. In
                    one circle show an illustration of 2 quarters and 2 pennies (a coin stamp) and in the other circle
                    show 3 dimes, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies with the question, &#8220;How much money do you have?&#8221;
                    Then children should write a corresponding equation to show the combining of both groups of coins,
                    write a word problem, and in the last section explain to a friend how to approach this problem.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
