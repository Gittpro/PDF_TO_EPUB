        <p>As an assessment tool, writing in journals, exit slips for older children, or other formats provide a unique
            window to children&#8217;s perceptions and the way they are thinking about an idea. Children can make sense
            of problems, express early ideas about concepts, unearth confusion, connect representations, or even clarify
            strategy use (Casa, 2015). When children
            explain their thinking about their solutions to a task in writing prior to class discussions, the written
            record serves as a rehearsal for the class conversation. Children who otherwise have difficulty thinking on
            their feet now have a script to support their contributions. Call on more reluctant talkers first so that
            their ideas are heard and valued.</p>
        <p>If you are working with PreK&#8211;1 children, writing in mathematics may sound too advanced as it may be
            difficult for prewriters and beginning writers to express ideas. To begin the development of the
            writing-in-mathematics process in these early grades, use a language experience approach. After an activity,
            you can write the words &#8220;Giant Journal&#8221; and a topic or prompt on a large chart or interactive
            whiteboard. As children respond to the prompt verbally, the teacher writes down their thoughts, including
            the contributor&#8217;s name and even drawings when appropriate, as in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0003_07.xhtml#fig_3-5">Figure 3.5</a>. All children can draw pictures of some sort to
            describe what they have done. Dots can represent counters or blocks. Shapes and figures can be cut out from
            duplicated sheets and pasted onto journal pages.</p>

            <p>The journal has a heading, giant journal, a subheading, today in math I discovered geoboards, and 6
                statements with corresponding pictures and student names. The statements are as follows. 1, two squares
                can make a rectangle; student, Megan; picture, two squares stacked to form a rectangle. 2, you
                can&#8217;t make a circle; student, Kayleigh; picture, a circle. 3, two triangles can make a square;
                student, Patrick; picture, a square is divided diagonally into 2 triangles. 4, a triangle touches three
                pegs; student, Bryan; picture, a triangle. 5, you can stretch the rubber band and make the same shape
                bigger; student, Kameron; picture, a triangle contains a smaller triangle that shares one side. 6, you
                can make pictures with different shapes; student, Dan; picture, a house is made of squares, rectangles
                and a triangle.</p>

        <p>In Mathematical Practice 3, mathematically proficient children are able to &#8220;justify their conclusions,
            communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others&#8221; (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_85" >NGA, 2010</a>, pp. 6&#8211;7). Helping
            children pull evidence to show how they answered a problem often requires showing them the work of other
            children. By showing exemplars and counterexamples from real or &#8220;created&#8221; peers, children begin
            to identify elements of a sound argument and cohesive communication (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_83"
                >Lepak, 2014</a>).</p>
