<h2 class="title">Rubrics and Their Uses</h2>
</header>
<p>Problem-based tasks tell us a great deal about what children know, but how do we analyze and use this information? These assessments yield an enormous amount of information that must be evaluated by examining more than a simple count of correct answers. A <em>rubric</em> is a scale based on predetermined criteria with two important functions: (1) It permits children to see what is central to excellent performance, and (2) it provides you with scoring guidelines that support equitable analysis of children&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>In a teaching-through-problem-solving approach, you will often want to include criteria and performance indicators on your rubrics such as the following:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Solved the problem(s) accurately and effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Persevered and demonstrated resilience when facing a challenging problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Explained strategies they used or justified their answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Used logical reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>Expressed a grasp of numerical relationships and/or mathematical structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporated multiple representations and/or multiple strategies.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrated an ability to appropriately select and use tools and manipulatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicated with precise language and accurate units.</p></li>
<li><p>Identified general patterns of ideas that repeat, making connections from one big idea to another.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title" id="ch03-head-06">Generic Rubrics</h3>
</header>
<p>Generic rubrics identify categories of performance instead of specific criteria for a particular task and therefore can be used for multiple assignments. The generic rubric allows you to score performances by first sorting into two broad categories, as illustrated in the four-point rubric shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_09.xhtml#fig_3-6">Figure 3.6</a>. Then you to separate each category into two additional levels as shown. A rating of 0 is given for no response, no effort, or for responses that are completely off task. The advantage of this scale is the relatively easy initial sort into &#8220;Got It&#8221; or &#8220;Not There Yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The box with title, scoring with a four point rubric, has two arrows that extend downward to, got it, and, not there yet. Got it: evidence shows that the student essentially has the target concept or idea. Not there yet: student shows evidence of major misunderstanding, incorrect concept or procedure, or failure to engage the task. Two arrows extend downward from, got it, to boxes labeled 4 and 3; and two arrows extend downward from, not there yet, to boxes labeled 2 and 1. The following list provides point category explanations, from right to left. 4, excellent, full accomplishment: strategy and execution meet the content, processes, and qualitative demands of the task. Communication is judged by effectiveness, not length. May have minor errors. 3, proficient, substantial accomplishment: could work to full accomplishment with minimal feedback. Errors are minor, so teacher is confident that understanding is adequate to accomplish the objective. 2, marginal, partial accomplishment: part of the task is accomplished, but there is lack of evidence of understanding or evidence of not understanding. Direct input or further teaching is required. 1, unsatisfactory, little accomplishment: the task is attempted and some mathematical effort is made. There may be fragments of accomplishment but little or no success.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to use your three- or four-point generic rubric on a reusable form (see <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Four-Point_Rubric.pdf" class="ulink">Four-Point Rubric</a>), as in <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_09.xhtml#fig_3-6">Figure 3.6</a>. This method is especially useful for planning purposes. But there are times when generic rubrics do not give enough definition of specific criteria for a particular task. For those instances, try a task-specific rubric.</p>
