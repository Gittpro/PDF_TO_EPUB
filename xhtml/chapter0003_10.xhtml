            </h3>
        </header>
        <p>Task-specific rubrics include specific statements, also known as <em>performance indicators</em> that
            describe what children&#8217;s work should look like at each rubric level and, in so doing, establish
            criteria for acceptable performance on that particular task (see <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0003_10.xhtml#fig_3-7">Figure 3.7</a> and <a
                    href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Anecdotal_Note_Rubric.pdf"
                    class="ulink">Anecdotal Note Rubric</a>). Initially, it may be difficult to predict what
            children&#8217;s performance at different levels will or should look like, but your criteria depend on your
            knowledge and experience with children at that grade level and your insights about the task or mathematical
            concept. One important part of setting performance levels is predicting children&#8217;s common
            misconceptions or their expected approaches to similar problems.</p>

            <p>An observation rubric, partition regions into equal shares, is dated 3, 17. The rubric is 3 rows by 2
                columns. The left column has rows with ratings and definitions, from top to bottom as follows. Row 1.
                Above and beyond: clear understanding. Communicates concept in multiple representations. Shows evidence
                of using idea without prompting. Can partition rectangles and circles into two, four, and eight equal
                shares. Explains that partitioning the same wholes into more shares makes smaller shares. Row 2. On
                target: understands or is developing well. Uses designated models. Can partition regions into equal
                shares and describes as halves and fourths. May need prompt to compare halves and fourths. Row 3. Not
                there yet: some confusion or misunderstanding. Only models idea with help. Needs help to do activity. No
                confidence. The right column has student names in each row. In this example, for the skill, partition
                regions into equal shares, the rows are further defined as follows. Above and beyond: can partition
                rectangles and circles into two, four, and eight equal shares. Explains that partitioning the same
                wholes into more shares makes smaller shares. On target: can partition regions into equal shares and
                describes as &#8220;halves&#8221; and &#8220;fourths.&#8221; May need prompt to compare halves and
                fourths. Not there yet: needs help to do activity. No confidence.</p>

        <p>To facilitate developing performance levels, write out indicators of &#8220;proficient&#8221; or &#8220;on
            target&#8221; performances before using the task. This excellent self-check ensures that the task is likely
            to accomplish your purpose. If you find yourself writing performance indicators in terms of the number of
            correct responses, you are most likely looking at drill or practice exercises, not the problem-based tasks
            for which a rubric is appropriate. Like athletes who continually strive for better performances rather than
            &#8220;good enough,&#8221; children should always recognize opportunities to excel. When you take into
            account the total performance (processes, strategies, answers, justifications, extensions, and so on), it is
            always possible to &#8220;go above and beyond.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Early in the year, discuss your rubric (such as <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_10.xhtml#fig_3-7">Figure
                3.7</a>) with the class and post it prominently. Make it a habit to discuss children&#8217;s performance
            on tasks in terms of the rubric. For example, if you are using the anecdotal note rubric, rubric language
            can be used informally: &#8220;Tanisha, <span id="page49" class="pagebreak" title="49" />the rubric states
            to get an Above and Beyond you need to solve the problem with two different representations and explain your
            thinking. Is that what you did?&#8221; This approach lets children know how well they are doing and
            encourages them to persevere by giving specific areas for improvement. You might also have children use the
            rubric to self-assess their work, having them explain reasons for their ratings. Then target follow-up
            instruction in response to their gaps and misunderstandings building on their identified strengths.</p>

            <p>Consider the task &#8220;<a class="xref" href="chapter0003_05.xhtml#print02">Shares</a>&#8221;. Assume
                you are creating a task-specific four-point rubric to share with your first graders. What task-specific
                indicators would you use for level 3 and level 4 performances? Start with a level 3 performance, then
                think about level 4. Try this before reading further.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Determining performance indicators is always a subjective process based on professional judgment. Here is one
            possible set of indicators for the &#8220;Share&#8221; task:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>Level 3:</em> Determines correct answer or uses an approach that would yield a correct answer if not
                for minor errors. The picture drawn or the explanation does not fully explain the combining and sharing
                process.</p>
            <p><em>Level 4:</em> Determines the total number of gumdrops and the amount of each equal share using words,
                pictures, and numbers to explain and justify the result and how it was obtained.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>What about level 1 and level 2 performances? Here are suggestions for the same task:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>Level 2:</em> Uses only two numbers in the addition instead of three and, therefore, fails to come up
                with the correct amount to share or adds correctly but does not carry out the division. The child shows
                some evidence of knowledge of addition but explanations and drawings are not aligned with the situation.
            </p>
            <p><em>Level 1:</em> Shows some effort but little or no understanding of addition or how to make equal
                shares.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Unexpected methods and solutions happen. Don&#8217;t limit children to demonstrating their understanding only
            as you thought they would when there is evidence that they are accomplishing your objectives in different
            ways. Such occurrences can help you revise or refine your rubric for future use.</p>

            <p>When you return papers, especially with second graders, review the indicators with children, including
                examples of correct answers and successful responses. This will help children understand how they could
                have done better. Often it is useful to show anonymous children&#8217;s work. Let children decide on the
                score for the anonymous child. Importantly, children need to see models of what a level 4 performance
                looks like.</p>

            <p>How can having children assess peers&#8217; work (both strong and weak responses) support their ability
                to generate more in-depth responses?</p>
