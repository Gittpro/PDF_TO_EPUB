<h2 class="title">Differentiation and Teaching Mathematics through Problem Solving</h2>
</header>
<p>Teachers have for some time embraced the notion that children vary in reading ability, but the idea that children can and do vary in mathematical development may be new. Mathematics education research reveals a great deal of evidence demonstrating that children can vary in their understanding of specific mathematical ideas. Attending to these differences in children&#8217;s mathematical development is key to differentiating mathematics instruction for your children.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the problem-based approach to teaching is the best way to teach mathematics while attending to the range of children in your classroom. In a traditional, highly directed lesson, it is often assumed that all children will understand and use the same approach and the same ideas as determined by the teacher. Children not ready to understand the ideas presented by the teacher must focus their attention <span id="page51" class="pagebreak" title="51"/>on following rules or directions without developing a conceptual or relational understanding (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_13" >Skemp, 1978</a>). This, of course, leads to endless difficulties and can leave children with misunderstandings or in need of significant remediation. In contrast, in a problem-based classroom, children are expected to approach problems in a variety of ways that make sense to <em>them,</em> bringing to each problem the skills and ideas that they own. So, with a problem-based approach to teaching mathematics, differentiation is already built in to some degree.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let&#8217;s consider a first-grade classroom in which the teacher provided the children with a picture of six dogs as shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0004_01.xhtml#fig_4-1">Figure 4.1(a)</a>. She asked the children to determine how many dogs are in the picture and to be ready to explain how they know. Following are some of the children&#8217;s explanations:</p>
<ul class="ul_none">
<li><p><strong>Carmen:</strong> I counted them and got 6. (Points to each dog and counts by ones.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sam:</strong> I counted them, too. But I counted by twos. (Puts two fingers over two dogs at a time and says, &#8220;Two, four, six.&#8221;)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edwin:</strong> I saw a pattern. I recognized the five, like on a die. I knew one more is six.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nora:</strong> I also saw a pattern. But I saw a group of 3 and 3&#8212;that is 6. (See <a class="xref" href="chapter0004_01.xhtml#fig_4-1">Figure 4.1(b)</a>.)</p></li>
</ul>

<header><h3 class="title"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">4.1</span> How many dogs are there? Nora&#8217;s solution: 3 and 3 is 6.</h3></header>
<img class="fx-lightbox preventTap" alt="Two boxes, a and b, each have 6 dogs and the phrase, how many dogs are there? The dogs in box a are not grouped and the dogs in box b are grouped, by circles, into two groups of 3 dogs each." src="../images/fig04-01.png"></img>
</figure>
<p>Some children are still counting by ones while others have begun skip counting or even recognizing the number of objects without counting. If the teacher had expected all children to count the dogs by ones, then many of the children might have used less-efficient methods than they would have independently used. Also, the cognitive demand of the task would have been lowered! If the teacher had expected all the children to recognize the number of objects without counting, then some children may have been confused because they still need to count objects by ones to determine how many. Instead, the teacher allowed the children to use their own ideas to determine how many dogs are in the picture. This expectation and the recognition that different children will approach and solve the same problem in various ways honors children&#8217;s varying mathematical development and sets the stage for differentiated <span id="page52" class="pagebreak" title="52"/>mathematics instruction. In addition, by listening to how different children approach the task, the teacher has acquired important information that can be used to plan subsequent instruction that meets a variety of children&#8217;s needs.</p>
