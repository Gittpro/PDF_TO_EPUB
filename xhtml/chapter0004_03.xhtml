</header>
<p>Knowing each child in the context of learning requires finding out who he or she is as an individual on traits such as readiness, interests, and learning profile.
<em>Readiness</em> refers to a child&#8217;s proficiency with the knowledge, understanding, and skills embedded in specific learning goals. <em>Interest</em> means a child&#8217;s attraction to particular topics, ideas, and events. Using contexts that are interesting and familiar to children enhances their attention and motivation to engage and achieve (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_113" >Sousa &amp; Tomlinson, 2011</a>). A <em>learning profile</em> identifies how a child approaches learning&#8212;how each child prefers to learn (e.g., in groups, alone); prefers to process and reason about information (e.g., by listening, observing, participating, or through talking; by thinking about details first and then the big picture or vice versa; by doing one task at a time or multitasking); and prefers to use or demonstrate what has been learned (e.g., writing, verbalizing, drawing). When deciding how to structure the environment, tasks, and assessments, consider children&#8217;s preferences for learning and you will greatly facilitate the learning process. This is not to say that you must narrow learning experiences to only children&#8217;s preferences all the time. That is simply impossible to do. What is possible is to look for opportunities to provide children some learning choices. Furthermore, knowing <span id="page53" class="pagebreak" title="53"/>children&#8217;s preferences alerts you to when they may need additional supports or guidance when those preferences are not possible to incorporate.</p>
<p>Information about your children&#8217;s traits can inform how you might modify different elements of the classroom (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_113" >Sousa &amp; Tomlinson, 2011</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_115" >Tomlinson, 2003</a>). You can gather information pertaining to children&#8217;s readiness by using preassessments several days before a given unit so that you have time to analyze the evidence and assess each child&#8217;s readiness for the unit. You can also use surveys, typically at the beginning and midpoint of the year, to gather information about children&#8217;s interests and learning profiles. Interest surveys give children opportunities to share personal interests (e.g., what they like to do after school, on the weekends, and during the summer; what school subjects they find most interesting and why) and information about pets, siblings, and extracurricular activities. Increase your children&#8217;s motivation and engagement by using their interests to provide contexts for the mathematics they are learning. Learning profile surveys or questionnaires also help children think about what helps them learn and what does not, such as preferring to work in pairs versus alone, being able to work with background noise, and needing to process ideas verbally (<a class="xref" href="chapter0004_03.xhtml#fig_4-2">Figure 4.2</a>). For younger children, use icons or images on the survey that they can circle to indicate their choice or conduct a quick informal interview using a checklist. Teacher observation can also provide valuable insights. By recording children&#8217;s information on index cards, you can quickly refresh your memory by looking through the cards as you plan lessons. You can also sort the cards to help you create groups based on interests or learning profiles.</p>
