        </header>
        <p>One challenge of differentiation is planning a task focused on a target mathematical concept or skill that
            can be used for whole-class instruction while meeting a variety of children&#8217;s needs. Let&#8217;s
            consider two different kinds of tasks that can meet this challenge: parallel tasks and open questions (<a

            <h3 id="ch04-head-04" class="title">Parallel Tasks</h3>
        </header>
        <p><em>Parallel tasks</em> are two or three tasks that focus on the same big idea but offer different levels of
            difficulty. The tasks should be created so that all children can meaningfully participate in a follow-up
            discussion with the whole class. You can assign tasks to children based on their readiness, or children can
            choose which task to work on. If they choose a task that is too difficult, they can always move to another
            task. Consider how the following parallel tasks emphasize the big idea of subtraction, but at different
            levels of difficulty.</p>

                <h2 class="title" id="ch04-print01">Task 1:</h2>
            </header>
            <p>There are 38 second graders on the playground; 22 of them come in for lunch. How many children are left
                on the playground?</p>
        </aside>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch04-print02">
            <header>
                <h2 class="title" id="ch04-print02">Task 2:</h2>
            </header>
            <p><span id="page56" class="pagebreak" title="56" />There are 108 second graders in our school; 29 of them
                leave on a field trip. How many second graders are left in the school?</p>
        </aside>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch04-stop-01">
            <header>
                <h2 class="title" id="ch04-stop-01">Stop and Reflect</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Which of the two tasks do you think would be more difficult, and why?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Both tasks provide opportunities for children to work with subtraction, but the numbers in the second task
            increase the level of difficulty regardless of the strategy a child uses. First, the numbers in the second
            task, 29 and 108, are farther apart than the numbers in the first task, 22 and 38. In the second task, if
            children use a counting-up strategy to determine the difference, they will need to move across multiple
            decades while keeping track of the count. Plus, crossing over the 100 mark can also be difficult for
            children. Even if children use the typical procedure for multidigit subtraction, the second task requires
            regrouping across a zero whereas the first task does not require regrouping at all.</p>
        <p>You can facilitate a whole-class discussion by asking questions that are relevant to both tasks. For example,
            with respect to the previous two tasks, you could ask the following questions of the whole class:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>How did you determine how many children were left?</li>
            <li>Some of you indicated that you added to find your answer. Why does adding make sense?
            </li>
            <li>Suppose one more child left. How would that change your answer?</li>
            <li>Suppose there had been one more child to begin with. How would that change your answer?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although children work on different tasks, because the tasks are focused on the same big idea, these
            questions allow them to extend their thinking as they hear others&#8217; strategies and ideas.</p>
        <p>For many problems involving computation, you can simply insert multiple sets of numbers to vary the
            difficulty. In the following problem, children are permitted to select the first, second, or third number in
            each set of brackets. Giving a choice increases motivation and helps children become more self-directed
            learners (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_101" >Bray, 2009</a>; <a

        <p>The following parallel tasks for kindergarten focus on the big idea of cardinality or counting to tell the
            number of objects (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0004_05.xhtml#fig_4-3">Figure 4.3</a>).</p>

        <p>With the first task, the teacher provides a task for children who are ready to find ways to organize their
            count. The parallel task still offers an opportunity for children to count <span id="page57"
                class="pagebreak" title="57" />but provides a built-in structure that can help children keep track of
            their count.</p>
        <p>In thinking about how to create parallel tasks, once you have identified the big idea you wish to focus on,
            consider how children might differ in their reasoning about that idea. The size of the numbers involved, the
            operations children can use, and the degree of structure inherent in the task are just a few things to
            consider as you create parallel tasks. Start with a task from your textbook and then modify it to make it
            suitable for a different developmental level. The original task and the modified task will serve as the
            parallel tasks offered simultaneously to your children. If you number the parallel tasks and allow children
            to choose the task they will work on, be sure there are instances in which the more difficult task is the
            first one. This randomness will ensure that children consider both options before they choose their task.
