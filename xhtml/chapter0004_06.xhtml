<h3 id="ch04-head-05" class="title">Open Questions</h3>
</header>
<p>Many questions found in textbooks are closed, meaning there is one answer and often only one way to get there. These kinds of questions cannot meet the needs of the range of learners in your classroom. Alternatively, open questions are broad-based questions that can be solved in a variety of ways or that can have different answers. Because these kinds of questions invite meaningful responses from children who are at varying developmental levels, they more readily meet the needs of a range of learners (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_111" >Small, 2012</a>). Following are two examples of open questions. Both questions can have different answers and can also be solved in a variety of ways.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="ch04-sidenote-05">
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>I measured an object in the classroom and found that it was 8 inches long. What could the object be?</li>
<li>The sum of three numbers is 25. What could the three numbers be?</li>
</ul>

<p>How would you solve each of these tasks? Can you think of at least two different strategies and at least two different answers for each task?</p>
</aside>
<p>Open questions have a high level of cognitive demand, as described in <a class="xref" href="chapter0002_00.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, because children must use more than recall or do more than merely follow steps in a procedure. As such, there are ample opportunities for them to approach the problems at their own level, which means open questions automatically accommodate for student readiness. Consequently, when given an open question, most children can find something <span id="page58" class="pagebreak" title="58"/>appropriate to contribute, which helps to increase their confidence in doing mathematics and can provide you insight into their level of understanding.</p>
<p>You can use a variety of strategies, such as the following, to create open questions (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_111" >Small, 2012</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_112" >Sullivan &amp; Lilburn, 2002</a>):</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>Give the answer and ask for the problem.</li>
<li>Replace a number in a given problem with a blank or a question mark.</li>
<li>Offer two situations or examples and ask for similarities and differences.</li>
<li>Create a question in which children have to make choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two previous examples of open questions illustrate the first strategy of giving an answer and asking for the problem. <a class="xref" href="chapter0004_06.xhtml#tab_4-1">Table 4.1</a> shows examples of using the three other strategies to convert standard questions to open questions.</p>

<p>Facilitating follow-up discussions is also important when you use open questions. While children work on an open question, walk around and observe the strategies they are using and the answers they are finding. During this time, plan which children will share their ideas during the follow-up discussion, ensuring that a variety of strategies and answers are examined. During the discussion, look for opportunities to help children make connections between different ideas that are shared. For example, in the preceding task in which children are finding two numbers that are 10 apart from each other, suppose some children identified 45 and 55 as their two numbers. One child might explain that to find the two numbers she used the hundreds chart, started at 45, and then moved down a row to 55. Another child might say that he started at 45 and counted 10 more using his fingers. Ask the class how the strategy of counting on your fingers could be shown on the hundreds chart or how moving down one row on the hundreds chart is the same as counting 10 on your fingers. Asking questions that help children build connections can support those who need additional help to track on significant ideas and can also challenge children to extend their understanding.</p>
