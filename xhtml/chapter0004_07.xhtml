<h2 class="title">Tiered Lessons</h2>
</header>
<p>In a tiered lesson, you set the same learning goals for all children, but different pathways are provided to reach those learning goals, thereby creating the various tiers. First, you need to decide which category you wish to tier: content, process, or product. If you are new to <span id="page59" class="pagebreak" title="59"/>preparing tiered lessons, tier only one category until you become more comfortable with the process. Once you decide which category to tier, determine the challenge of each of the defined tiers based on student readiness levels, interests, and learning profiles (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_105" >Kingore, 2006</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_106" >Murray &amp; Jorgensen, 2007</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_114" >Tomlinson, 1999</a>). <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_106" >Murray and Jorgensen (2007)</a> suggest starting by creating three tiers to make the process more manageable: a regular tier or lesson, an extension tier that provides extra challenge, and a scaffolding tier that provides more background or support. Once you have this framework, you can design as many tiers as needed to meet your children&#8217;s needs. All tiered experiences should have the following characteristics (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_113" >Sousa &amp; Tomlinson, 2011</a>): </p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>Address the same learning goals.</li>
<li>Require children to use reasoning.</li>
<li>Be equally interesting to children.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have already considered some ways to tier the content by using parallel tasks and open questions. However, varying the degree of challenge is not just about the content. You can also tier lessons using any of the following four aspects (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_105" >Kingore, 2006</a>):</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><strong><em>Degree of assistance.</em></strong> If some children need additional support, you can partner children, provide examples, help them brainstorm ideas, or provide a cue sheet (<a class="xref" href="chapter0004_07.xhtml#fig_4-4">Figure 4.4</a>).
<figure class="figure lc_img66 fx-lightbox" id="fig_4-4">
<header><h3 class="title"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">4.4</span> Problem-solving cue sheet.</h3></header>
<img aria-details="longdesc_la_005" class="fx-lightbox preventTap" alt="A cue sheet." src="../images/fig04-04.png"></img>
</figure>
<details id="longdesc_la_005">
<summary>Expand/collapse description</summary>
<p>A problem solving cue sheet is a 2 by 6 array. The left column has a header that reads, ways to help me think about the problem. The right column has the header, 5 + 7 = blank, followed by rows with different methods of problem-solving, written and illustrated,as follows: 5 plus 7 = blank; counting chips, with 2 shaded circles and 1 unshaded circle; ten-frame, with a 2 by 5 ten frame that contains 7 circles; finger counting, with an open hand; drawing, with a pencil; and other.</p>
</details>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Structure of the task.</em></strong> Some children, such as children with disabilities, benefit from highly structured tasks. However, gifted children often benefit from a more open-ended structure.</li>
<li><strong><em>Complexity of the task.</em></strong> Make tasks more concrete or more abstract and/or include more difficult problems or applications.</li>
<li><strong><em>Complexity of the process.</em></strong> As you think about your learners, ask yourself these questions: How quickly should I pace this lesson? How many instructions should I give at one time? How many higher-level thinking questions are included as part of the task(s)?
</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider in the following examples how the original task is modified to change the level of challenge:</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch04-print05">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch04-print05">Original Task:</h2></header>
<p><strong>Elliot had 9 toy cars. Sasha came over to play and brought 8 cars. How many cars do Elliot and Sasha have together? Explain how you know.</strong></p>
<p>The teacher has distributed cubes to children to model the problem and paper and pencil to illustrate and record how they solved the problem. He asks them to model the problem and be ready to explain their solution.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch04-print06">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch04-print06">Adapted Task:</h2></header>
<p><strong>Elliott had some toy cars. Sasha came over to play and brought her cars. How many cars do Elliott and Sasha have together? Explain how you know.</strong></p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page60" class="pagebreak" title="60"/>The teacher asks children what is happening in this problem, how they might solve the problem, and what tools might help them solve the problem. Then the teacher distributes task cards that tell how many cars Elliot and Sasha have. The teacher has varied the difficulty of the numbers, giving children who are struggling sums that are less than 10 and the more advanced children sums greater than 20.</p>
<p><strong>Card 1 (easier)</strong></p>

<p>Elliot has 5 cars and Sasha has 3 cars.</p>
<!--<figure class="figure lc_img33 fx-lightbox" id="fig_card-1">
<img class="fx-lightbox preventTap" alt="" src="../images/unfig04-02.jpg"></img>
</figure>-->
<p><strong>Card 2 (middle)</strong></p>
<p>Elliot has 9 cars and Sasha has 8 cars.</p>
<!--<figure class="figure lc_img33 fx-lightbox" id="fig_card-2">
<img class="fx-lightbox preventTap" alt="" src="../images/unfig04-03.jpg"></img>
</figure>-->
<p><strong>Card 3 (advanced)</strong></p>
<p>Elliot has 17 cars and Sasha has 16 cars.</p>
<!--<figure class="figure lc_img33 fx-lightbox" id="fig_card-3">
<img class="fx-lightbox preventTap" alt="" src="../images/unfig04-04.jpg"></img>
</figure>-->
<p>In each case, children must use words, pictures, models, or numbers to show how they figured out the solution. Various tools are provided (connecting cubes, counters, number line, and hundreds chart) for children&#8217;s use.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch04-stop-03">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch04-stop-03">Stop and Reflect</h2></header>
<p>Which of the four aspects that change the challenge of tiered lessons was addressed in the adapted task?</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page61" class="pagebreak" title="61"/>You would preassess your children to determine the best ways to use these task cards. One option is to give children only one card, based on their current academic readiness (e.g., easy cards to those who have not yet mastered addition of single-digit numbers). A second option is to give out cards 1 and 2 based on readiness, then use card 2 as an extension for those who successfully complete card 1, and card 3 as an extension for those who successfully complete card 2. In each of these cases, you will need to record at the end of the lesson which children were able to model and explain the various levels of the problems so that the next lesson can be planned appropriately. Notice that this tiered lesson addresses both the complexity of the task (difficulty of different cards) and the process (instructions are broken down by starting with the no-numbers scenario).</p>
<p>The following example illustrates how to tier a lesson based on <em>structure</em>. Notice that the different tasks vary in how open-ended the work is, yet all tasks focus on the same learning goal of analyzing and comparing two-dimensional shapes.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch04-ler-07">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch04-ler-07">
Learning Objective: (CCSS-M: K.G.B.4)</h2>
</header>
<p><strong>Analyze and compare two-dimensional shapes, in different sizes and orientations, using informal language to describe how they are the same and how they are different, or parts (e.g., number of sides and vertices/&#8220;corners&#8221;).</strong></p>
<p>Children are given a collection of two-dimensional shapes (e.g., squares, a variety of triangles, nonsquare rectangles, hexagons). Some children may be given collections that have fewer shapes and fewer varieties of shapes in each category. The tasks are distributed to different groups based on their learning needs and prior knowledge of two-dimensional shapes.</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><em>Group A:</em> Explore the set of shapes. For each kind of shape, what do you notice about the shape? Make a list of the ideas that you think are true for each kind of shape.
[open-ended]</li>
<li><em>Group B:</em> Explore the set of shapes. For each kind of shape, what do you notice about the number of sides and the number of corners (vertices)? [slightly structured]</li>
<li><em>Group C:</em> First, sort the shapes into like shapes. Count the number of sides and the number of corners (vertices) of each shape. Use the following table to record your findings. What do you notice about the number of sides and the number of corners (vertices) for each kind of shape? [most structured]</li>
</ul>

<p>The three tiers in this lesson reflect different degrees of difficulty in terms of task structure. However, all children are working on the same learning objective and they all must engage in reasoning about the shapes to complete their tasks.</p>
<p>In <a class="xref" href="chapter0006_00.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> you will read about response to intervention (RtI), a multitier student-support system that offers struggling children increasing levels of intervention. We want to distinguish between the tiers in RtI and tiered lessons used in differentiation. In RtI the tiers refer to the <span id="page62" class="pagebreak" title="62"/>different degrees of intervention offered to children as needed&#8212;from the first tier, which occurs in a general education setting and involves the core instruction for all children based on high-quality mathematics curriculum and instructional practices, to the upper tier, which could involve one-on-one instruction with a special education teacher. Tiered lessons used in differentiation would be an avenue to offer high-quality core instruction for all children in the first tier or level of RtI.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch04_teach02">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch04_teach02">Teaching Tip</h2></header>

<p>Make sure children understand the vocabulary used in tasks before they begin working independently. For instance, two of the tasks in the tiered lesson example use the words <em>sides</em> and <em>corners</em>. Before they start the tasks, have a group discussion with children who are assigned these tasks about the meaning of the terms.</p>
