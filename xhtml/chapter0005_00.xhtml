        </header>
        <p>We are lucky to be in a country composed of people from all over the world. The percentage of culturally and
            linguistically diverse children in the United States continues to increase. In 2012&#8211;2013, 9.2 percent,
            or about 4.4 million children, participated in an ELL program in public schools (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_144" >Kena et al., 2015</a>), and about 24 percent
            (almost 18 million) of U.S. children are Latino (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_117"
                >Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2014</a>). Collectively, our children provide rich
            diversity in cultural practices and languages, and this must be reflected in our mathematics classrooms.
            Teaching for access, equity and empowerment requires high expectations for all children and this means that
            in planning, teaching, and assessing, we are responsive to children&#8217;s backgrounds, experiences,
            cultural perspectives, traditions, and knowledge (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_154"
                >NCTM, 2014</a>). </p>

        </header>
        <p>Children from different countries, regions, or experiences, including those who speak different languages,
            are often viewed as challenges to a teacher or school. Rather, children&#8217;s varied languages and
            backgrounds <span id="page65" class="pagebreak" title="65" />should be seen as a resource in teaching (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_141" >Guti&#233;rrez, 2009</a>). Valuing a
            person&#8217;s cultural background is more than a belief statement; it is a set of intentional actions that
            communicate to the child, &#8220;I want to know about you, I want you to see mathematics as part of your
            life, and I expect that you can do high-level mathematics.&#8221; In getting to know children, we access
            their funds of knowledge&#8212;the essential knowledge or information that they use to survive and thrive
            (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_151" >Moll et al.,1992</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_129" >Chao, Murray, &amp; Guti&#233;rrez,
                2014</a>). Unfortunately, too many teachers view non-Asian and non-European ELLs as behind academically
            and socially, and lacking the skills needed to succeed (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_126"
                >Chval &amp; Pinnow, 2010</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_166"
                >Vollmer, 2000</a>).</p>
        <p>Instead of teaching children from a deficit model (i.e., focusing on their lack of knowledge and experience),
            we can connect children&#8217;s experiences at home and with family to those of the mathematics classroom.
            Family and community activities, such as playing games, weaving, cooking, and story-telling, can serve as
            cultural and linguistic resources in learning mathematics. </p>
