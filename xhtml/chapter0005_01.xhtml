</header>
<p>Mathematics is commonly referred to as a &#8220;universal language,&#8221; but this is not the case. Conceptual knowledge (e.g., what division is) is universal. Procedures (e.g., how you divide or factor) and symbols are culturally determined and are not universal. For example, the subtraction process varies from country to country in how it is notated and the language that is used to describe the process. <a class="xref" href="chapter0005_01.xhtml#fig_5-1">Figure 5.1</a> illustrates three ways to subtract, along with the countries that teach that process (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_158" >Perkins &amp; Flores, 2002</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_160" >Secada, 1983</a>). </p>

<p>A table of the subtraction algorithms, divided into the missing addend approach and the equal addition subtraction, has a column for the step in the algorithm, and for an explanation or think aloud for each step. The missing addend approach, used in France, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Mexico, Latin America, and other places. First step: 52 minus 17 = blank, shown vertically. Done mentally, start with the ones place. Think 12 minus 7. Subtract. Second step: 52 minus 17 = 5, with a raised 1 next to the 1 in the tens place in 17. Because 10 is added to the 2, ones, 10 is also added to the lower number, so mentally the lower number is now 27. Third step: 52 minus 17 = 35. What is 2 tens from 5 tens? Three tens. The answer: 35. Equal addition subtraction, used in Latin America and the United States, less common. 52 minus 17 = blank, shown vertically. Done mentally, I can&#8217;t take 7 from 2, but I can add 3 to the 7 to get 0, 0 can be taken away from any number. If I add 3 to the bottom number, I must also add it to the top number. Second step: 52 with 2 crossed out and a 5 above, minus 17 with both digits crossed out and replaced by 20 = 35. Note: this is notated for the reader but is often done mentally in actual practice. Two from 5 is 3, tens. The answer is 35.  The table continues on the following page. A table of the subtraction algorithms, with a column for the step in the algorithm, and for an explanation or think aloud for each step. Negative numbers to subtract, used in eastern Europe, Russia, Latvia, Ukraine and other places. First step: 52 minus 17 = blank, shown vertically. 7 from 2 is negative 5. Second step: 52 minus 17 = negative 5. 1 from 5 is 4. Third step: vertical subtraction with rows as follows; 5 and 12, minus, 1 and 7 = 4 and negative 5; 3 and 5. 40 minus 5 is 35.</p>

<p><span id="page66" class="pagebreak" title="66" />Commas and periods are sometimes used in reverse, for example, 1,400 meaning 1.400 as written in the United States. Numerals are sometimes written differently. For example, in many countries the numeral 1 is written more like a 7 with a sharper angle (<strong><em>1</em></strong>), and the 7 has a horizontal line through it to distinguish it from the one (<strong><em>7</em></strong>) (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_160" >Secada, 1983</a>). Treating mathematics as a universal topic can lead to inequities in the classroom as children from other cultures may not recognize the symbols and processes being used in their class, even if they know the content, and therefore may not be able to participate and learn. </p>
<p>What we value and how we engage in &#8220;doing mathematics&#8221; is part of cultural practice. For example, mental mathematics is highly valued in other countries, whereas in the United States, recording every step is valued. Could you follow the first strategy in <a class="xref" href="chapter0005_01.xhtml#fig_5-1">Figure 5.1</a>? Each represents different, yet equally efficient and effective, strategies for solving subtraction problems. The critical equity question, though, is not just whether you can follow an alternative approach, but how will you respond when you encounter children using such an approach? </p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Will you require children to show their steps (disregarding the way they learned it)?</p></li>
<li><p>Will you ask children to elaborate on how they did it?</p></li>
<li><p>Will you have these children show other children their way of thinking?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of requiring children to write all their steps, ask them to think aloud as they solve a problem, or ask how they did it in their head.</p>
</aside>
<p>The latter two responses communicate to the child that you are interested in his or her way of knowing mathematics, and that there are many ways in which different people and different cultures approach mathematics. Supporting a range of strategies for algorithms is an important way to show that you value children as individuals and is a good way to gain insights into possible culturally influenced strategies (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_140" >Guti&#233;rrez, 2015</a>). </p>
