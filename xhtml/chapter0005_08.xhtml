<p>If a teacher wants to understand what a child knows about mathematics, then the child should be able to communicate that understanding in a way that is best for the child, even if the teacher may need a translation. Research shows that ELLs perform better when a test is given in their native language (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_159" >Robinson, 2010</a>). Several strategies can assist teachers in using formative assessments with ELLs, including tasks with multiple entry and exit points, diagnostic interviews, tasks that limit the linguistic load, accommodations, and self-assessment. </p>

<p>An aspect of teaching mathematics through problem solving that is important, particularly for ELLs, is to select tasks carefully. If a problem can be solved in multiple ways, an ELL is more likely to be able to design a strategy that makes sense and then illustrate that strategy. Inviting children to show and/or explain their strategy provides options for ELLs to use words and pictures to communicate their thinking. </p>
