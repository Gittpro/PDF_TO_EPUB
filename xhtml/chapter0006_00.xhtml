        <p>The NCTM position statement on Access and Equity in Mathematics Education states that we should hold the
            expectation that all children can reach mathematics proficiency and that high levels of performance must be
            attained regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, ability, or linguistic background
            including those in special education and gifted education (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_197"
                >NCTM, 2014</a>). Children need opportunities to advance their knowledge
            supported by teaching that gives attention to their individual learning needs. Children&#8217;s backgrounds
            are not only an important part of who they are as people, but who they are as learners&#8212;and this
            background enriches the classroom.</p>
        <p>Many <em>achievement</em> gaps are actually <em>instructional</em> gaps or <em>expectation</em> gaps. It is
            not helpful when teachers set low expectations for children, as when they say, &#8220;I just cannot put this
            class into groups to work; they are too unruly&#8221; or &#8220;My students with disabilities can&#8217;t
            solve word problems&#8212;they don&#8217;t have the reading skills.&#8221; Operating under the belief that
            some children cannot do mathematics ensures that they don&#8217;t have ample opportunities to prove
            otherwise. Instead, we suggest you consider <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_204"
                >Storeygard&#8217;s (2010)</a> mantra for teachers which
            proclaims&#8212;&#8220;My kids can!&#8221;</p>
        <p>We know that teaching for equity is much more than providing children with an equal opportunity to learn
            mathematics, instead, it attempts <span><span id="page81" class="pagebreak" title="81" />to attain equal
                outcomes for all children by being sensitive to individual differences. How you will maintain equal
                outcomes and high expectations while providing for individual differences with strong support can be
                challenging. Equipping yourself with an ever-growing collection of instructional strategies for a
                variety of students is critical. A strategy that works for one child may be completely ineffective with
                another, even for a child with the same exceptionality. Addressing the needs of <em>all</em> means
                providing access and opportunity for: </span></p>

            <li>
                <p>Children who are identified as struggling or having a disability.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Children who are mathematically gifted.</p>

                <p>Children who are unmotivated or need to build resilience.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may think, &#8220;I do not need to read the section in this chapter on mathematically gifted children
            because they will be pulled out for math enrichment.&#8221; Children who are mathematically talented need to
            be challenged in the daily core instruction, not just when they are participating in a gifted program.</p>
        <p>One of the basic tenets of education is individualizing the content taught and methods used for children who
            struggle, particularly those with special needs. Mathematics learning disabilities are best thought of as
            cognitive differences, not cognitive deficits (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_189"
                >Lewis, 2014</a>). Children with disabilities often have mandated
            individualized education programs (IEPs) that guarantee access to grade-level mathematics
            content&#8212;preferably in a general education classroom. This legislation also implies that educators
            consider individual learning needs not only in terms of <em>what</em> mathematics is taught but also
            <em>how</em> it is taught.
        </p>
        <p>Essential in making decisions about how you can adapt instruction to meet individual learner&#8217;s needs is
            the use of accommodations and modifications. An accommodation is a response to the needs of the environment
            or the learner; it does not alter the task. For example, you might write down directions for a child instead
            of just saying them orally. A modification changes the task, making it more accessible to the child. For
            example, if kindergartners are asked to try to use simple geometric shapes to form larger shapes, you might
            show the outlines of the two smaller shapes for the children to find and place directly on top of their
            exact outlines. Then give them the outline of the larger shape they will form. Then the next shape they will
            attempt without the modification. When modifications result in an easier or less demanding task,
            expectations are lowered. Modifications should be made in a way that leads back to the original task,
            providing scaffolding or support for learners who may need it. Complete an <a

            for children in your classroom who have special needs. Record the evidence that you are adapting the
            learning situation.</p>
        <p>In this chapter, we share research-based strategies that reflect these equity principles while providing
            appropriate accommodations and modifications for the wide range of children in your classroom.</p>

            <h3 class="title" id="ch06-head-01">Prevention Models</h3>
        </header>
        <p>In many school systems, a systematic process for achieving higher levels performance for all children often
            includes a multitiered system of support (MTSS) frequently called response to intervention (RtI). This
            approach commonly emphasizes ways for struggling students to get immediate assistance and support rather
            than waiting for children to fail before they receive help or also for identifying children who are far
            exceeding standards and need additional challenges. Multitiered models are centered on the three interwoven
            elements: high-quality curriculum, instructional support (interventions), and formative assessments that
            capture children&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. Often this model is used to determine whether low
            achievement is due to a lack of high-quality mathematics (i.e., &#8220;teacher-disabled students&#8221;) (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_172" >Baroody, 2011</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_207" >Ysseldyke, 2002</a>) <span id="page82"
                class="pagebreak" title="82" />or due to an actual learning disability. This model can also help
            determine more intensive, instructional options for students who may need to have additional advanced
            mathematical challenges beyond what other children study.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title" id="chap6-head4_1">Response to Intervention</h4>
        </header>
        <p><strong>RtI</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkK1bT8ls0M"
                    class="ulink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkK1bT8ls0M</a>) is a multitiered student
            support system often represented in a three-tier triangle format. As you might guess, there are a variety of
            RtI models developed by school systems as they structure their unique approaches to meeting children&#8217;s
            needs. As you move up the tiers the number of children involved decreases, the teacher&#8211;student ratio
            decreases, and the level of intervention increases. Each tier in the triangle represents a level of
            intervention with corresponding monitoring of results and outcomes, as shown in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0006_00.xhtml#fig_6-1">Figure 6.1</a>. The foundational and largest portion of the triangle
            (Tier 1) represents the core instruction for <strong>all</strong> children based on high-quality mathematics
            curriculum, highly engaging instructional practices (i.e., manipulatives, conceptual emphasis, etc.) and
            progress monitoring assessments. For example, if using a graphic organizer in Tier 1 core instruction the
            following high-quality practices would be expected in the three phases of the lesson&#8212;<em>Before,
                During,</em> and <em>After</em>:</p>

            <p>A triangle is divided horizontally into 3 unequal parts. Bottom to top the parts are as follows: tier 1,
                all students, 80 to 90%; tier 2 is smaller, small groups, 5 to 10%; tier 3 is the smallest part,
                individual students, 1 to 5%. Common features across tiers are as follows. Research-based practices:
                prevention begins with practices based on students' best chances for success. Data-driven: all decisions
                are based on clear objectives and formative data collection. Instructional: prevention and intervention
                involve effective instruction, prompts, cues, practice, and environmental arrangements. Context
                specific: all strategies and measures selected to fit individual schools, classrooms, or students.</p>

        <p><em>Before.</em> States purpose, introduces new vocabulary, clarifies concepts from needed prior knowledge in
            a visual organizer, and defines tasks of group members (if groups are being used).</p>
<p> <em>During.</em> Displays
            directions in a chart, poster, or list; provides a set of guiding questions in a chart with blank spaces for
            responses.</p>
        <p><em>After.</em> Facilitates a discussion to highlight or make more explicit the significant concepts or
            skills and then presents a summary and list of important concepts as they relate to one another.</p>
        <p>Tier 2 represents children who did not reach the level of achievement expected during Tier 1 instruction.
            Children who move to Tier 2 should receive supplemental targeted instruction (interventions) using more
            explicit strategies with systematic teaching of critical skills and concepts, more intensive and frequent
            instructional opportunities, and more supportive and precise prompts (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_205"
                >Torgesen, 2002</a>). The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics&#8217;
            position statement on Interventions (2011) endorses the use of interventions that increase in intensity as
            children demonstrate continuing struggle with learning mathematics. Interventions may require &#8220;heroic
            action to preclude serious complications&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_180"
                >Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2001</a>, p. 86).</p>
        <p>If further assessment reveals children have made favorable progress, the extra interventions are faded and
            discontinued. But, if difficulties and struggles still remain, the interventions can be adjusted in
            intensity, and in rare cases, children are referred to the next tier of support. Tier 3 is for children who
            need more intensive assistance, which may include comprehensive mathematics instruction or a referral for
            special education evaluation or special education services. Instructional strategies for the three tiers are
            outlined in <a class="xref" href="chapter0006_00.xhtml#tab_6-1">Table 6.1</a>.</p>

                class="pagebreak" title="83" />A key to guiding children&#8217;s movement within the multitiered prevention model is the monitoring of their
            progress. One way that you can collect evidence of children&#8217;s knowledge of concepts through the use of
            diagnostic interviews (examples are described in <a class="xref" href="chapter0003_00.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>
            and throughout the book in a feature called Formative Assessment Notes) (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_185" >Hodges, Rose &amp; Hicks, 2012</a>). Another
            approach is to assess children&#8217;s growth toward fluency in basic facts, an area that is well-documented
            as a barrier for children with learning disabilities (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_192"
                >Mazzocco, Devlin, &amp; McKenney, 2008</a>). Combining instruction with short
            daily assessments proved to be a way to help children not only be better at remembering the facts but better
            at <span><span id="page84" class="pagebreak" title="84" />generalizing to other facts (<a
                    class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_208" >Woodward, 2006</a>). The collection of
                information gathered from these assessments will reveal whether children are making the progress
                expected or if more intensive instructional approaches need to be put into place. </span></p>
