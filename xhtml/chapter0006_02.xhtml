</header>
<p>The CSA (concrete, semi-concrete, abstract) intervention has been used in mathematics education for a variety of topics for years (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_179" >Dobbins, Gagnon, &amp; Ulrich, 2014</a>; Griffin, Jossi, &amp; van Garderen, 2012; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_184" >Heddens, 1964</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_186" >Hunter, Bush, &amp; Karp, 2014</a>). Based on <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_174" >Bruner and Kennedy&#8217;s stages of representation (1965)</a>, this model ref lects concrete representations such as manipulative materials that encourage learning through movement or action (enactive stage) to semi-concrete representations of drawings or pictures (iconic stage) and learning through abstract symbols (symbolic stage). Built into this approach is the return to <span><span id="page86" class="pagebreak" title="86"/>visual models and concrete representations as children need or as children begin to explore new concepts or extensions of concepts learned previously. As children share reasoning that shows they are beginning to understand the mathematical concept, there can be a shift to semi-concrete representations. This is not to say that this is a rigid approach that only moves to abstraction after the other phases. Instead, it is essential that there is parallel modeling of number symbols throughout this approach to explicitly relate the concrete models and visual representations to the corresponding numerals and equations. CSA also includes modeling the mental conversations that go on in your mind as you help children articulate their own thinking. Used particularly in a combination with explicit strategy instruction, this approach has met with high levels of success for children with disabilities (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_178" >Flores, Hinton, &amp; Strozier, 2014</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_191" >Mancl, Miller, &amp; Kennedy, 2012</a>, <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_194" >Miller &amp; Kaffar, 2011</a>). </span></p>
