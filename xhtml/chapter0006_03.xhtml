<p>Children with special needs also benefit from other children&#8217;s modeling and support (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_193" >McMaster &amp; Fuchs, 2016</a>). The basic notion is that children learn best when they are placed in the role of an apprentice working with a more skilled peer or &#8220;expert.&#8221; Although the peer-assisted learning approach shares some of the characteristics of the explicit strategy instruction model, it is distinct because knowledge is presented on an &#8220;as-needed&#8221; basis as opposed to a predetermined sequence. The children can be paired with older children or peers who have more sophisticated understandings of a concept. At other times, tutors and tutees can reverse roles during the tasks. Having children with disabilities &#8220;teach&#8221; others is an important part of the learning process, so giving children with special needs a chance to explain their thinking to a peer or younger child is a valuable learning tool.</p>
