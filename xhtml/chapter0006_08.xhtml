<p>Enrichment activities go into depth beyond the topic of study to content that is not specifically a part of your grade-level curriculum but is an extension of the original mathematical tasks. For example, while studying place value to very large numbers, mathematically gifted children can stretch their knowledge to study other large numbers such as a google. This provides an extended view of how our base-ten numeration system fits within the broader systems of recording very large numbers. Other times the format of enrichment can involve studying the same topic as the rest of the class while differing on the means and outcomes of the work. Examples include group investigations, solving real problems in the community, writing data-based letters to outside audiences, or identifying applications of the mathematics learned.
