<p>By presenting open-ended problems and investigations children can use divergent thinking to examine mathematical ideas&#8212;often in collaboration with others. These collaborative experiences could include children from a variety of grades and classes volunteering for special mathematics projects, with a classroom teacher, principal, or resource teacher taking the lead. Their creativity can be stimulated through the exploration of mathematical &#8220;tricks&#8221; using binary numbers to guess classmates&#8217; birthdays or design large-scale investigations of the amount of food thrown away at lunchtime (Karp, K. &amp; Ronau, R., 1997). A group might find mathematics in art (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_175" >Bush, Karp, &amp; Nadler, 2015</a>). Another aspect of creativity provides different options for children in culminating performances of their understanding, such as demonstrating their knowledge through inventions, experiments, simulations, dramatizations, visual displays, and oral presentations.</p>
<p>Noted researcher on the mathematically gifted, Benbow (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_199" >Read, 2014</a>), states that acceleration combined with depth through enrichment is best practice. Then learning is not only sped up but the learning is deeper and at more complex levels.</p>
