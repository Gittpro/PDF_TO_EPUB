</header>
<p>A common concern of parents is that their children are not learning standard algorithms or the procedures they remember using when they were in elementary school. You must address (at least) two points related to this critical issue. First, the skills that parents are looking for (e.g., invert and multiply for dividing fractions) are still in the curriculum&#8212;they just may look different because they are presented in a way based on understanding, not just memorization. Standard algorithms are still taught but they are taught <em>along with</em> alternative (or invented) strategies that build on students&#8217; number sense and reasoning. Let parents experience that both invented and standard algorithms are important in being mathematically proficient by inviting them to solve the following problems:</p>
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render39.png" alttext="table row cell 1399 plus 547 equals _____     5009 minus 998 equals _____ end cell row cell 487 plus 345 equals _____ plus 355 end cell end table" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation"><mrow><mtable><mtr><mtd><mn>1399</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>547</mn><mo>=</mo><mi>_____</mi><mo>&#x2003;</mo><mo>&#x2003;</mo><mn>5009</mn><mo>&#x2212;</mo><mn>998</mn><mo>=</mo><mi>_____</mi></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mn>487</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>345</mn><mo>=</mo><mi>_____</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>355</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></math></p>
<p>Ask for volunteers to share the ways that they thought about the problems. For the subtraction problem, for example, the following might be shared:<span id="page100" class="pagebreak" title="100"/></p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print02">
<p>5000 take away 1000 is 4000, then add the 9 and 2 back on to get 4011.</p>
<p>998 up to 1000 is 2, up to 5000 is 4002, and up 9 more is 4011.</p>
<p>5009 to 5000 is 9, then down to 1000 is 4000 more (4009), and then down to 998 is 2 more (4011).</p>
</aside>
<p>These invented strategies, over numerous problems, reinforce place-value concepts and the relationship between addition and subtraction. Noticing that these values are both near 1000 helps to select a strategy. The standard algorithm for this problem is very messy, and one that frequently results in computational errors. The best choice for solving this problem is one of the ways described above. The key to procedural fluency is to first assess the values in the problem and then decide how to solve it. This bird&#8217;s-eye view of the problem is important in doing mathematics&#8212;rather than always doing the same thing regardless of the numbers. This is very evident in the third example, which can be solved with no computation if the relationships among the numbers are first noticed.</p>
<p>Second, what is &#8220;basic&#8221; in the 21st century is much more than computation. Many topics in early elementary school were not a part of the curriculum a generation ago (e.g., connecting numbers and algebra). Looking together through the essential concepts in the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> or the NCTM <em>Curriculum Focal Points</em> helps parents see that the curriculum is not just an idea generated at their child&#8217;s school but the national consensus on what children need to learn.</p>

<p>Parents may also wonder why there are fewer skill/practice problems and more story problems in the curriculum. Effective mathematics learning environments are rich in language. Real mathematics involves more &#8220;word&#8221; problems and far fewer &#8220;naked number&#8221; skill problems. In contrast to when the parents went to school, skills are now less needed in the workplace because of available technology, but the importance of number sense, reasoning, and being able to solve real problems has increased. Because some children struggle with reading and/or writing, share strategies you use to help them understand and solve story problems (<a class="xref" href="chapter0007_02.xhtml#fig_7-1">Figure 7.1</a>).</p>
