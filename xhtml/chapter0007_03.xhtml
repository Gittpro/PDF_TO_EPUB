<p>At the heart of parents&#8217; interest in school mathematics is wanting their child to be successful, not only in the current classroom but also at the next level of school.
</p>

<h4 class="title" id="chap7-head4_8">Preparation for College and Career</h4>
</header>
<p>If your state has implemented the <em>Common Core State Standards</em>, you can share that the standards are for K&#8211;12 and designed to prepare students for college and future careers. The
<em>Common Core State Standards</em> website has an increasing number of resources for parents (<a href="http://corestandards.org" class="ulink">http://corestandards.org</a>) to help them ensure that their child is college- and career-ready. Because the standards are at least as rigorous as prior state standards, and have an increased focus on student reasoning and sense making, they better prepare children for high-stakes assessments such as the ACT or SAT, which over the years have adapted to reflect changes in content expectations in high school curriculum, such as the increased focus on statistics (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_225" >Jaschik, 2014</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_234" >Peterson&#8217;s, 2015</a>). As noted in the CCSS myths and facts, these standards are more rigorous, and therefore better prepare children for high-stakes assessments, and still prepare children to take algebra in eighth or ninth grade.</p>
<p>Parents may be more interested in how your specific school is doing in preparing children for the future. Share evidence from your school of mathematics success, including stories about an individual child (no name given) or the success of a particular classroom, like the following one received by a principal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was worried at the start of the year because my son didn&#8217;t have a lot of confidence in math and he was coming home with problems that he was supposed to figure out his own way to solve. I wondered why the teacher hadn&#8217;t shown him how to add or subtract. But now I can really see his number sense&#8212;he has all kinds of ways he adds numbers and can do it in his head. And he is really good at solving and writing his own story problems! As an aside, I am also learning a lot&#8212;I didn&#8217;t learn this way, but I am finding the homework problems are really interesting as we figure them out. I am just curious if this is something he will get to do again in second grade, or if this is just the way first-grade teachers introduce the ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such communications help parents see that there is a transition period and that in the end a standards-based approach helps engage children and build their understanding over time.</p>

<h4 class="title" id="chap7-head4_9">Productive Struggle</h4>
</header>
<p>Parents may worry when they see their child struggle with a single mathematics problem because they may believe that fast means successful. But faster isn&#8217;t smarter. The book <em>Faster isn&#8217;t Smarter</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_236" >Seeley, 2009</a>) is a great read on this topic written for families, educators, and policy makers. Seeley offers 41 brief messages, many of which can address parent questions about mathematics (e.g., &#8220;A Math Message to Families: Helping Students Prepare for the Future,&#8221; &#8220;Putting Calculators in their Place: The Role of Calculators and Computation in the Classroom,&#8221; and &#8220;Do It in Your Head: The Power of Mental Math&#8221;). As noted above, engaging children in productive struggle is one of the two most effective ways teachers can help children develop conceptual understanding (the other is making connections among mathematical ideas) (Bay-Williams, 2010; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_223" >Hiebert &amp; Grouws, 2007</a>). Rather than presenting a series of simpler problems for children to practice, standards-based curricula characteristically focus on fewer tasks, each of which provides children with an opportunity for higher-level thinking, multiple strategy solutions, and more time focused on math learning.</p>
<p>Share the first Standard for Mathematical Practice (<a class="xref" href="chapter0007_03.xhtml#fig_7-2">Figure 7.2</a>), and ask the parents what they notice. Focus on the importance of <em>perseverance.</em> This is true in mathematics and in life.&#160;<span id="page102" class="pagebreak" title="102"/></p>

<p>Reassure parents that some tasks take longer because of the nature of the tasks, not because their child lacks understanding. Mathematics is not nearly as much about speed and memorization as it is about being able to grapple with a novel problem, try various approaches from a variety of options, and finally reach an accurate answer.
