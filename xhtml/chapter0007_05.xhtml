<h2 class="title">Family Engagement</h2>
</header>
<p>Parents know the importance of mathematics for their child&#8217;s future. They participate in their child&#8217;s learning by supporting homework, attending back-to-school nights or PTA meetings, and by meeting with teachers, even if they may recall unpleasant experiences or difficulties <span id="page104" class="pagebreak" title="104"/>with school mathematics from their own schooling. Understanding that memories of mathematics classes are not always pleasant for parents and appreciating parental support prepare us to suitably identify for parents the mathematics goals that children should be experiencing in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Communication with families is key to encouraging their support and involves using one-way, two-way, and three-way communication strategies (<a class="xref" href="chapter0007_05.xhtml#fig_7-3">Figure 7.3</a>).</p>

<p>Numerous studies have found a positive relationship between the level of parental involvement and their child&#8217;s achievement in school (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_209" >Aspiazu, Bauer, &amp; Spillett, 1998</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_222" >Henderson et al., 2002</a>). Parents need frequent opportunities to get information directly from the school leaders and teachers about their child&#8217;s mathematics program, including the kind of instruction that might differ from what they experienced in their own schooling. Even if your school has been engaged in implementing a mathematics program for a decade that ref lects the NCTM <em>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</em> and now the <em>Common Core State Standards,</em> the program will still be new to the parents of your children.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="chap7-head3_5">Family Math Nights</h3>
</header>
<p>There are many ways to conduct a family or community mathematics event, such as including a math component in a back-to-school night, discussing it in a PTA meeting, or hosting a showcase for a new mathematics program. One idea is to host a Math Orientation Workshop (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_221" >Ernst &amp; Ryan, 2014</a>). The purpose of this even is to develop consistency between the way math is taught in school and the way parents help at home. Beyond a focus on the content, parents can learn about <em>dispositions</em> of effective problem solvers, including the importance of asking questions; developing persistence; using multiple ways to solve problems; learning from mistakes; and reflecting on whether solutions make sense (see <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_221" >Ernst and Ryan [2014]</a> for more details on designing and implementing this event). Providing opportunities to parents to learn about specific mathematics topics prior to their children learning the topics can <span id="page105" class="pagebreak" title="105"/>lead to increased relationships with parents and increased student achievement (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_227" >Knapp, Jefferson, &amp; Landers, 2013</a>).</p>
<p>Critical to any plan is providing opportunities for parents to be learners of mathematics so that they can experience what it means to <em>do mathematics</em> (just like their children). When choosing mathematical tasks to use with parents, be sure the tasks focus on content that really matters to them and relates to what they already know is a part of the elementary curriculum (e.g., addition and subtraction, including basic facts, as well as place value are good ideas in grades K&#8211;2). There are tasks throughout this text that are ideal for a math night. <a class="xref" href="chapter0007_05.xhtml#fig_7-4">Figure 7.4</a> contrasts two examples of first-grade problems for learning about combinations (sums) that make 6&#8212;one is straightforward and lends to a single procedure (solve the problems as modeled by the teacher using counters) and one that is designed for a teaching-through-problem-solving experience (explore and find different combinations).</p>

<p>Welcome back or family math nights are a great time to have parent&#8211;child teams experience doing math tasks together.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch07-stop-03">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch07-stop-03">Stop and Reflect</h2></header>
<p>What distinctions do you notice between the two tasks? What is valued as &#8220;doing mathematics&#8221; in both of the problems?</p>
</aside>
<p>The contrasting addition problems are perfect for discussing with parents what it means to do mathematics because they (1) address critical areas in the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> and focal points in the <em>Curriculum Focal Points,</em> (2) involve using manipulatives (color tiles or counters), (3) connect the mathematical ideas of partitioning and addition, and (4) (in the latter example) have multiple solution strategies.
</p>
<p>The potential each of these problems has to support and challenge children in making sense of mathematics should be made explicit during a discussion with parents. After giving parents time to do both tasks and discuss solution strategies (as you would with children), connect the learning experience to their questions and concerns. Ask participants to consider the learning opportunities in the two contrasting tasks. Ask questions such as the following:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>What skills are being developed in each problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Which problem gives more opportunity to make connections between mathematics and the real world?</p></li>
<li><p>Which task would your child be more motivated to solve? Why?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="page106" class="pagebreak" title="106"/>Help parents identify the depth of the mathematics in the teaching-through-problem-solving task. Remind them that in grades K through 2, children are building important foundations of number and operations through algebraic reasoning&#8212;looking for patterns, reasoning, and generalizing. Help parents see these aspects in the car combination problem. Share the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> and the NCTM standards (in parent-friendly language), and focus on the goal of having children becoming mathematically proficient as described in those standards. Ask parents, &#8220;Where do you see these proficiencies being supported in the two tasks we did?&#8221;</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="Teaching Tip 2">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch_07_teach04">Teaching Tip</h2></header>

<p>Provide copies of the appropriate <em>Common Core State Standards</em> Introduction and Overview pages (the first two pages for each grade), and allow parents time to think about each &#8220;Critical Area.&#8221;</p>
</aside>
<p>Another good choice for family math nights is basic fact strategies, as addition and subtraction facts are a central part of the curriculum in grades K&#8211;2, and developing
<em>reasoning strategies</em> is essential to learning the facts well. (Parents may only know f lash cards or other memorization activities.) See <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_00.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> for the three phases of fact mastery, as well as games and activities for developing reasoning strategies.
</p>
<p>Address any or all of the questions in <a class="xref" href="chapter0007_00.xhtml#Tab_7-1">Table 7.1</a> that apply to your setting. One way to do this is to have parents write their questions on note cards and collect them so you can identify common questions and decide the order in which to discuss each one.</p>
