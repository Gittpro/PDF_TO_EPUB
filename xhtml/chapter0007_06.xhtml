<p>Invite parents to engage in your mathematics lessons, observing or interacting with students. An invitation to come to a mathematics lesson or a math event (e.g., family math night) gives parents the chance to witness firsthand such things as how you ask questions, how problems can be solved in many ways, and how calculators can be used to support reasoning. They may notice that you encourage children to select their own strategy and explain how they know it works. Parents will also pick up on the language that you are using and will be able to reinforce that language at home. You can even provide a note-taking template that includes categories such as the following:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>What is the big idea of the lesson?</p></li>
<li><p>What illustrations or tools are being used to help students (your child) understand?
</p></li>
<li><p>What are some questions the teacher is asking that I could also ask?</p></li>
<li><p>What does the teacher do when a student (my child) is stuck or needs challenged?
</p></li>
</ul>
