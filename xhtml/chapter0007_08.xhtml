<h2 class="title">Homework Practices and Parent Coaching</h2>
</header>
<p>You may have heard parents say, &#8220;I am not good at math&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t like solving math problems.&#8221; While parents may feel this way, such messages to their child can impede their success in mathematics. In fact, a parent&#8217;s emotions are connected to the student&#8217;s emotions, and these positive emotions are connected to better performance (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_220" >Else-Quest, Hyde, &amp; Hejmadi, 2008</a>). It is our responsibility as educators to figure out ways to redirect parents to portray mathematics in a positive light.</p>

</header>
<p>Explicitly teaching parents <em>how to</em> help their children has also been found to make a difference in supporting student achievement and student attitudes (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_219" >Cooper, 2007</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_220" >Else-Quest et al., 2008</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_233" >Patall, Cooper, &amp; Robinson, 2008</a>). Take the following recommendations into consideration when thinking about the homework that you will assign to your children.</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li><p><em>Mimic the three-phase lesson model.</em> <a class="xref" href="">Table 2.5</a> describes the three-phase lesson model. Homework can reflect these general phases. Complete a brief version of the <em>Before</em> phase of a lesson to be sure the homework is understood before children go home. At home, children complete the <em>During</em> phase. When they return with the work completed, apply the sharing techniques of the <em>After</em> phase of the homework. <span id="page108" class="pagebreak" title="108"/>Children can even practice the <em>After</em> phase with their family if you encourage this through parent or guardian communications. Some form of written work must be required so that children are held responsible for the task and are prepared for the class discussion. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Use a distributed-content approach</em>. Homework can address content that has been taught earlier in the year as practice, that day&#8217;s content as reinforcement, or upcoming content as groundwork. Interestingly, research has found that distributed homework (homework that combines all three components) is more effective in supporting student learning (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_219" >Cooper, 2007</a>). The exception is students with learning disabilities, who perform better when homework focuses on reinforcement of skills and current class lessons.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Promote an &#8220;ask-before-tell&#8221; approach with parents</em>. Parents may not know how best to support their child when he or she is stuck or has gotten a wrong answer. One important thing you can do is to ask parents to implement an &#8220;ask-before-tell&#8221; approach (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_226" >Kliman, 1999</a>). This means that before parents explain something, they should ask their child to explain how he or she did it. The child may self-correct (a life skill), and if not, at least the parents can use what they heard from their child to provide targeted assistance. Teach successful homework strategies to children, and share these strategies with parents. For example, the following ideas, suggested by <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_238" >Wieman and Arbaugh (2014)</a>, can be posted in your classroom and sent home:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Look for examples in our notes or daily work. Try those problems again.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are stuck, take a break, then come back and try again.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are confused, write a statement or question describing what is confusing.
</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for help using specific questions (from parents, peers, or online support sites)
</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>Provide good questioning prompts for parents.</em> Providing guiding questions for parents or guardians supports a problem-based approach to instruction as they help their children. <a class="xref" href="chapter0007_08.xhtml#fig_7-5">Figure 7.5</a> provides guiding questions that can be included in the children&#8217;s notebooks and shared with families. Translating questions for parents who are not native speakers of English is important. Often, a child can help you with this task.</p>

</figure>
</li>
<li><p><em>Use Games and Interactives.</em> Find opportunities to assign games or interactives for homework. The intent is that the child plays with family members (e.g., parent, sibling). The game can be played as part of a lesson and then sent home to play two to three times, with a written summary of what happened as they played due the next day. Games can be assigned to develop fluency with such concepts as reinforcing basic facts, operations, number recognition, counting, and so on. Fixed-Addend War (adapted from <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_214" >Britt, 2015</a>), is one such engaging activity that can be offered as a homework option at various times throughout the year.</p></li>

<p>Providing specific guidance to families makes a big difference in what to do (and <em>not</em> do) to help their children learn mathematics and be confident in doing mathematics.</p>
</aside>
<p>Several features of this game make it a great choice for homework: It only requires a deck of cards. Children can choose the fixed addend, or the parent can pick one for which they think their child needs practice. Finally, it sets up opportunities for mathematical discussion. For example, asking &#8220;How did you solve it?&#8221; and &#8220;What reasoning strategy might you use?&#8221; help the student to develop and practice strategies and parents to hear those strategies.</p>
<p>Many interactives and applets are available across content strands (some of which are shared throughout Part 2 of this book). Asking children to explore, play, or solve on an <span id="page109" class="pagebreak" title="109"/>applet can be another way to engage families with doing mathematics. A favorite is <em>Deep Sea Duel</em>, which can be found in Classroom Resources on the NCTM website. This is a fun strategy game that helps children practice sums and differences, as they are trying to reach a target and win the game. </p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch07-print02">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch07-print02">Game: Fixed Addend War</h2>
</header>
<p>Use a deck of cards, removing face cards. Identify an addend (e.g., 9) and place one of those values in the middle. Deal the rest of the cards to the two players, face down. Each player turns up a card, says the sum, followed by the addition sentence, taking turns with who goes first. The player with the larger sum gets the cards.
</p>
<p>Example: Fixed Addend is 9. Player one turns up a 2 and says &#8220;Eleven&#8212;Nine plus two equals eleven (or two plus nine is eleven).&#8221; Player 2 two turns up a 6 and says,
&#8220;15&#8212;Nine plus six equals fifteen.&#8221; If there is a tie&#8212;it is a &#8216;war&#8217; and they repeat the process, but the winner of the next round wins both sets of cards.</p>
</aside>
<p>Homework of this nature communicates to families the problem-based or sense-making nature of your classroom and might help them see the value in this approach. A final note: A little bit goes a long way&#8212;if children are to spend time solving meaningful problems, then just a few engaging problems a night can accomplish more than a long set of practice problems.</p>
