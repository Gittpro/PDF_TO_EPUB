<p>In the same way that families support literacy by reading and talking about books with their children, families can and should support numeracy. Because this has not been the practice in many homes, it means you, as the teacher, have the responsibility to help parents see the connection between numeracy and everyday life. Consider asking families to make the <em>Math Promise</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_229" >Legnard &amp; Austin, 2014</a>). Family members make this promise to one another, which means they explicitly agree they will do math together&#8212;get to know each other&#8217;s mathematical reasoning, play math games, and notice mathematics in their daily lives. In her article &#8220;Beyond Helping with Homework: Parents and Children Doing Mathematics at Home,&#8221; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_226" >Kliman (1999)</a> offers some excellent suggestions, which include asking parents to share anecdotes, find mathematics in the books they read, and create opportunities during household chores. <a class="xref" href="chapter0007_10.xhtml#fig_7-6">Figure 7.6</a> provides a sample letter home that suggests these ideas to parents.</p>

<p>The letter to parents contains sections describing four strategies for infusing mathematics into parents&#8217; interactions with their child: share stories, connecting to reading, chores, and scavenger hunts. The letter heading at the top reads, making math moments matter. The first paragraph of the letter reads as follows. Dear Families: As a second grader, your child is increasingly aware of what is going on in the world. In that world is a lot of math! In our class this year we are working on place value, as well as learning about standard units of measurement, describing and analyzing shapes, and addition and subtraction of three-digit numbers. It will really help your child to understand and see the importance of math if you find ways to talk about math moments, on any math topic, but especially these four critical areas. We call it Making Math Moments Matter, M4 for short. Here are some ways to have fun with M4 at home. Share stories. Share a math moment at dinner, or in the car. When have you used math today: shopping, laundry, budgets, et cetera? Think of the many things you might have estimated, how long it will take to get to work or to run a series of errands. Take turns sharing stories. We will share family math moments in class. Connecting to reading. As they tell you about the book they are reading, ask quantity-type questions. How many shapes do you see in that picture? How many more pages do we have to finish the book? How long, in inches or centimeters, do you think that animal is? Chores. Yes, chores! If it takes 45 minutes to do a load of laundry, how long will 3 loads take? If you walk the dog for 10 minutes twice each day, how many hours is the dog walked in 10 days? If you earn five dollars an hour walking dogs, what might you earn in a week? Scavenger hunts. Riding in the car can be more interesting if there are things to look for. Consider challenging your child to look for numbers on signs and to say them correctly. Search for as many shapes as you can, for instance: a train car is a rectangular solid, a trash can is a cylinder, et cetera.</p>

<p>Trips in the car can include informal and fun mathematics explorations. For example, license plates can be noted and family members can try to use the numbers on the plate to create a true mathematics equation or someone can select a target number, and the values from the plate are used to try to reach that target number (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_224" >Hildebrandt, Biglan, &amp; Budd, 2013</a>). Today&#8217;s Date (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_232" >Mistretta, 2013</a>) is another activity that can be a part of informal family discussions. Today&#8217;s Date involves taking the date (e.g., 18) and thinking of different expressions, ways to write it, and connections to personal interests (e.g., a favorite athletes number or the age of a cousin). These tasks have many possible solutions and can be used repeatedly at any time of the year.<span id="page111" class="pagebreak" title="111"/></p>
