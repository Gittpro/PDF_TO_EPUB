        </header>
        <p>Families help children as young as two or three years of age count their fingers, toys, people at the table,
            and other small sets of objects. Questions such as &#8220;Who has more?&#8221; or &#8220;Are there
            enough?&#8221; are part of many children&#8217;s daily lives. Evidence indicates that when children have
            such experiences, they begin to develop understanding of the concepts of number and counting (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_241" >Baroody, Li, &amp; Lai, 2008</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_244" >Clements &amp; Sarama, 2014</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_260" >National Research Council, 2009</a>). In
            addition, findings from recent brain research suggest that children who are most proficient with number are
            those who f lexibly use different brain pathways&#8212;one associated with numbers and symbols and the other
            associated with spatial reasoning (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_261" >Park &amp;
                Brannon, 2013</a>). We therefore include an abundance of activities in this chapter to support the
            different experiences children need to gain a thorough understanding of number concepts.</p>

        <p>No matter what prior experiences children have had before coming to school, we need to strive to help all
            children develop the following four interrelated aspects of early numerical knowledge (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_244" >Clements &amp; Sarama, 2014</a>):</p>

                <p><em>One-to-one correspondence</em>. Counting objects by saying number words in a one-to-one
                    correspondence with the objects</p>

            <li>
                <p><span id="page114" class="pagebreak" title="114" />
                    <em>Cardinality.</em> Understanding that the last number word said when counting tells how many
                    objects have been counted
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Subitizing.</em> Quickly recognizing and naming how many objects are in a small group without
                    counting. Young children can recognize and name quantities of objects that are less than four
                    without counting.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Children must construct these ideas through a variety of experiences and activities. They cannot be forced.
            As children work on each of these aspects of early counting, their understanding about counting is
            continually refined. For example, children will learn <em>how</em> to count (matching counting words with
            objects) before they understand that the last count word indicates the <em>amount</em> of the set or the
            <em>cardinality</em> of the set. A teacher can at the same time use subitizing to emphasize the notion of
            cardinality and to help emphasize the notion that counting tells &#8220;how many.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>Research-based learning trajectories (also called <em>learning progressions</em>) can help you use
            information about your children&#8217;s current knowledge to design and sequence instructional tasks to move
            children to more advanced ways of reasoning. One such learning trajectory for counting identifies
            increasingly sophisticated levels of reasoning that range from having no counting skills (i.e., precounter)
            to being able to count using complex strategies that move beyond counting by ones (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_244" >Clements &amp; Sarama, 2014</a>). <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0008_01.xhtml#Tab_8-1">Table 8.1</a>, based on this research, provides a
            selection of levels and sublevels identified as benchmarks in the trajectory (pp. 36&#8211;46). Teachers who
            are aware of this learning trajectory for counting are better able to design instructional tasks that are
            purposefully targeted at moving children along the trajectory from one level to the next.</p>

                Learning Number Sequences</h4>
        </header>
        <p>One of the first necessary skills for verbal counting is to be able to produce the standard list of counting
            words in order: &#8220;One, two, three, four . . .&#8221; Although learning the forward and backward number
            sequence may be considered a rote procedure, effort should be made to help children build the number
            sequence in a meaningful way, especially numbers in the teens. One recommendation is to play off number
            words in other languages where the structure of the numbers is more explicit. For example, in Japanese the
            number 11 is <em>ju ichi,</em> which translates to &#8220;ten and one,&#8221; the number 12 is <em>ju
                ni</em>, which translates to &#8220;ten and two,&#8221; and so on. You can also use a vertical number
            line to help children visualize how numbers change as they begin writing two-digit numbers (see <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0008_01.xhtml#fig_8-1">Figure 8.1</a>). A vertical number line is more
            intuitive than the typical horizontal number line because as numbers become larger they are higher on the
            number line as opposed to further to the right.</p>

        <p>Although the forward number sequence is relatively familiar to most young children, mastering the backward
            number sequence, counting back, and counting on from a particular number are often difficult for young
            children. Eventually, first graders should be able to start from any number less than 120 and count on from
            there (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). Provide children
            frequent opportunities to practice the number-word sequence in both forward and reverse order and begin
            counts with numbers other than 1 through short and engaging activities such as the following.</p>

            </header>
          
            <p><strong>CCSS-M: K.CC.A.1; K.CC.A.2</strong></p>
            
            <p>Counting up to and back from a target number in a rhythmic fashion is an important counting exercise.
                Line up five children and five chairs in front of the class. As the whole class counts from 1 to 5, the
                children sit down one at a time. When the target number, 5, is reached, it is repeated; the child who
                sat on 5 now stands, and the count goes back to 1. As the count goes back, the children stand up one at
                a time, and so on, &#8220;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, . . . .&#8221; Any rhythmic movement
                (clapping, turning around, doing jumping jacks) can be used as the count goes up and back. Vary the
                activity by starting at numbers other than one. For example, use 15 to 20 if the class is working on the
                teen numbers and use something like 55 to 65 if the class is ready to move to larger numbers (both of
                these ranges fit with kindergarten expectations in CCSS). Children find exercises such as this both
                engaging and challenging. To modify this activity for English language learners, give each child who is
                in front of the class one card from a set of cards with the target numerals (e.g., 1 to 5, 15 to 20, or
                55 to 65) and the corresponding number word. These cards will provide a visual to help children connect
                the written numeral and number word to the number being said.</p>
        </aside>

        <p>An extension for the previous activity involves having children stand in a circle and count around the circle
            to a target number. One child starts the count at number 1; the next child says the next number in the
            sequence, and so on, until a child says the target number. That child sits down and the next child starts
            the count again at number 1. The activity continues until one child is left standing. Challenge children by
            asking them to predict who will sit down next or who will say a particular number. You can vary the activity
            by using shorter or longer sequences, by starting the count at a number other than 1, or by having the
            children count backward.</p>

            <p>When learning the number sequence, some children do not realize that each number word represents a
                separate number, so they may touch two objects as they say two-syllable counting words such as

                    class="ulink">Numeral Cards</a> to prepare a set of cards (one numeral per card) that
                represents a sequence of numbers you want the children to work with, say, 0 through 20 for kindergarten.
                Mix the cards and then place them face down in a pile. Ask a child to take the top card and use a
                clothespin to place the card on the clothesline. Have a second child take the next card and place that
                card on the clothesline in the appropriate position relative to the first card. Before children place
                their numeral cards, ask the class questions such as &#8220;Is this number before or after . . .&#8221;
                and &#8220;Does this number go on the left or the right of . . .?&#8221; Continue until all the cards
                are placed on the clothesline in a sequence. Then have the children read the sequence forward as well as
                backward and discuss the need for equal spacing. If any number is out of sequence or is too closely
                spaced, see if the children can determine how to correct the order and placement of the cards. You can
                modify this activity by using shorter or longer sequences and by using number sequences that start at
                different numbers. Once children are familiar with this activity, use the <a

        <p>You can use children&#8217;s literature as a lead-in to counting objects and counting backward. For example,

                >Litwin, 2012</a>) is a story about a cat who starts with four groovy buttons
            on his shirt. But one by one they pop off and he ends up with zero&#8212;or does he? As he counts down, the
            numeral is shown, along with the written word. (Note there is also a related subtraction equation shown.)
            <em>Ten in the Bed</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_245" >Dale, 2007</a>) is
            another book that offers practice opportunities to count backward from ten to one using the classic song

        <p>Numeral recognition and writing are part of learning to count. Kindergartners are expected to write numbers
            from 0 to 20 in the <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242" ><em>Common Core State
                    Standards</em> (2010)</a>. Helping children read and write the 10 single-digit numerals is similar
            to teaching them to read and write letters of the alphabet. Neither has anything to do with number concepts.
            However, numeral writing can be engaging. For example, ask children to trace over numerals in shaving cream
            on their desks, make numerals from clay, press the numeral on a calculator, write them on the interactive
            whiteboard or on a partner&#8217;s back, and so on. In the following activity, children work on number
            recognition as a class.</p>

                not a match to anyone in the room. Alternatively children can find a peer with the same numeral. This
                activity can progress to including cards that show the corresponding amount instead of the numeral. A

                Developing One-to-One Correspondence</h4>
        </header>
        <p>After learning the number sequence a child must be able to connect this sequence in a one-to-one
            correspondence with the objects in the set being counted. Each object must get one and only one count.
            Regular classroom activities, such as matching the number of napkins or snacks needed at snack time and the
            number of materials needed for an activity to the children in the class, or even simply taking attendance
            where each child posts a smiley face sticker, are opportunities for children to engage in purposeful
            counting that emphasizes one-to-one correspondence. Make sure during these activities that children have
            sets of blocks or counters to move as they count and that the activity is more than the children simply
            following the teacher&#8217;s count. The following activities provide specific opportunities focused on
            one-to-one correspondence.</p>

                that thinks someone has been in his house because of all the footprints he keeps finding. In the end, it
                is revealed that he is the one creating all the footprints! Give pairs of children a <a

                    class="ulink">Moose Tracks Game Board</a>, one die, and two game pieces, such as
                different colored centimeter cubes. Children take turns rolling the die and moving their game piece
                along the game board. Play is collaborative with players helping each other. Play continues until both
                children have traveled the length of their tracks. Because the board has separate spaces for each
                &#8220;moose track,&#8221; children work on one-to-one correspondence as they move their game piece
                along the board. Alternatively, rather than moving one game piece along the board, have children place
                the number of same colored centimeter cubes along their track that corresponds to the number on the die.
                For example, if the child rolls a 4, he places 4 red cubes along his track in 4 separate spaces. For his
                next turn, he uses a different color of cube, say 3 blue cubes for a 3 on the die. By using several of
                the same colored cubes, as opposed to moving just one cube along the board, the child has a visual
                record of the one-to-one correspondence. This representation also provides a more explicit visual of
                cardinality&#8212;the number of cubes in a group.</p>

            <p>In pairs, children roll one die. For each dot on the die, they place one counter into each compartment of
                an egg carton (you can also use a plastic ice cube tray). Ask the children, &#8220;How do you know you

                carton?,&#8221; and &#8220;How many more do you need to fill the carton?&#8221; They continue to take
                turns rolling the die and placing counters into the egg carton until the carton is full. Require that

            children with disabilities, it is important to have a plan for counting. The children should count objects
            from left to right, move the objects as they count, or touch them as they say each number word aloud.</p>

        </header>
        <p><a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_247" >Fosnot and Dolk (2001)</a> state that an understanding of cardinality and its connection to counting is not a
            simple task for four-year-olds. Children will learn how to count (matching counting words with objects)
            before they understand that the last number stated in a count indicates the amount of the set (how many you
            have in all) or the set&#8217;s cardinality as shown in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0008_01.xhtml#fig_8-2">Figure 8.2</a>. Children who make this connection are said to have
            the cardinality principle, which is a refinement of their early ideas about quantity and is required for
            kindergartners (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). Most, but
            certainly not all, children by age 4&#189; make this connection (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_247"

                used to fill four empty spaces. To modify this activity for a child with disabilities or for any child
                who is struggling with counting, use a die with only 2 or 3 dots or numerals on the sides. Using a
                larger-sized die also makes it easier for the child to count the dots. You can increase the number
                choices on the die when you have evidence that the child is counting accurately. A modification for

            <p>Children who successfully count orally may not have attached meaning to their counts. To determine
                whether a young child understands cardinality, listen to how the child responds when you discuss
                counting tasks with him or her. For example, show the child a card with five to nine large dots in a row
                so that they are easy to count. Ask the child to count the dots. If the count is accurate, ask,
                &#8220;How many dots are on the card?&#8221; Early on, the child may need to recount again, but a child
                who is beginning to grasp the meaning of counting will not have to recount. If the child points to the
                last object counted as representing the number of dots on the card, this can be an indication that the
                child has not constructed the idea of cardinality of a set. If the child correctly responds with and
                refers to the total counters, now say,
                &#8220;Please give me the same number of counters as there are dots on the card.&#8221; Here is a
                sequence of indicators to look for, listed in order from a child who does not attach meaning to the
                count to a child who is using counting as a tool:</p>

            <p>Place index cards numbered 1 to 10 in a box. Depending on your children&#8217;s readiness, you may need
                to include a dot representation of the number on the card. In pairs, children pull out a card and then
                collect that number of objects from a designated area in the classroom. The objects could be books,
                pencils, cubes, crayons, counting bears, and so on. They place their numbered card and the collected
                objects in a container. In pairs they check the other children&#8217;s collections to make sure they
                have collected the correct number of objects. Vary the difficulty of this activity by using smaller
                numbers (2&#8211;5) or larger numbers (15&#8211;20). Initially you want children to collect the same
                kind of object, but eventually have them collect a mix of objects to introduce the idea that you can
                count different kinds of objects in a collection. For example, they can collect two crayons, one marker,
                and one pencil for the number 4&#8212;four things to write with! Children can use <a

            <p>Use a computerized version of the game Concentration at NCTM&#8217;s Illuminations website to help
                children relate numerals to number words and quantities. If needed, you can reduce the level of
                difficulty by selecting the option to have all the numerals, numbers, and quantities visible so that the
                child can focus on moving back and forth between the representations without having the added difficulty
                of remembering the locations of specific cards.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Subitizing</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Children explore quantity before they can count. For example, they can identify which cup is bigger or which
            plate of blueberries has more berries. Eventually they need to attach an amount to the quantities to explore
            them in greater depth. When you look at an amount of objects, sometimes you are able to just
            &#8220;see&#8221; how many are there, particularly for a small group. For example, when you roll a die and
            know that it is five without counting the dots, that ability to &#8220;just see it&#8221; is called
            <em>subitizing</em>. There are times when you are able to do this for even larger amounts, say when you
            break apart a group of eight dots shown in a pattern by seeing five dots and then three dots.
            &#8220;Subitizing is a fundamental skill in the development of children&#8217;s understanding of
            number&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_240" >Baroody, 1987</a>, p. 115) and
            can be developed and practiced through experiences with patterned sets such as those that can be found on
            dice and dominoes.
        </p>
        <p>Many children easily recognize patterned sets of dots on dice due to the many games they have played. Similar
            instant recognition (<em>subitizing</em>) can be developed for other patterns (see <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0008_01.xhtml#fig_8-4">Figure 8.4</a>). Naming these amounts <span id="page121"
                class="pagebreak" title="121" />immediately without counting facilitates <em>counting on</em> (from a
            known patterned set) or learning combinations of numbers (seeing a patterned set of two known smaller
            patterns). To support young children with subitizing begin with three or four objects arranged in symmetric
            patterns before moving to larger numbers such as five or more challenging arrangements.</p>

            smaller patterns or a pattern with one or two additional dots. These should be made in two colors to
            distinguish each of the smaller patterns. Keep the patterns compact and organized. If the dots are too
            spread out, the patterns are hard to identify.</p>

        <p>The next activity displays images quickly so that children do not have time to count the dots one by one.
            Consequently, they are challenged to find another way to determine how many. Dot plates <span id="page122"
                class="pagebreak" title="122" />that have three to five dots are useful to start work on subitizing. Dot
            plates that have more than five dots are useful in helping children work on advanced subitizing or
            decomposition where they quickly see and use small groups within the larger amount to quickly determine how
            many.</p>
