        <p>We find that because early counting often involves touching an object, zero is sometimes not included in
            discussions about numbers and counting. Children need to explore the number zero because it is one of the
            most important digits in the base-ten system, and purposeful conversations about it and its position on the
            number line are essential&#8212;and it is a required standard for kindergartners (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). Surprisingly, zero is not
            a concept that is easily grasped without intentionally building understanding. In fact, it took quite a long
            time for zero to be accepted as a number in many cultures because its nature is so different from other
            numbers (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_253" >Kaplan, 2000</a>). But three- and
            four-year-olds can begin to meaningfully use the word zero and the numeral 0 to communicate that there are no
            objects in the set (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_244" >Clements &amp; Sarama,
                2014</a>). With the dot plates discussed previously (see <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0008_01.xhtml#fig_8-5">Figure 8.5</a>), use the zero plate to discuss what it means when
            there is no dot on the plate. Relate zero to meaningful contexts to which your children are familiar. In
            particular, <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_01.xhtml#ch08-Activity-8-10">Activities 8.10</a>, <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0008_01.xhtml#ch08-Activity-8-11">8.11</a>, and <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0008_04.xhtml#ch08-Activity-8-15">8.15</a> are useful in exploring the number zero.</p>
