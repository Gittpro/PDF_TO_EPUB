        <p>Initially, when asked to combine two sets, children will have to count from one, even if they have already
            counted one of the sets. For example, if after counting five bears a child is given three more and asked how
            many there are in all, the child may need to recount the five bears, starting the count from one.
            Eventually, children will be able to start counting a quantity from a given number other than one. This is
            called &#8220;counting on.&#8221; Using the previous example, a child who can count on will
            <span id="page123" class="pagebreak" title="123" />usually say, &#8220;Five (referring to the group of five
            bears), six, seven, eight. I have eight bears.&#8221; The child may keep track of the count by holding up a
            finger with each number (six, seven, eight). <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_247"
                >Fosnot and Dolk (2001)</a> describe counting on as a <em>landmark</em> on a
            child&#8217;s path to number sense.
        </p>
        <p>Let&#8217;s consider two activities that are designed to help children move from counting from one to
            counting on. In both activities the counted objects are hidden to encourage the child to create a mental
            image of the quantities&#8212;which helps children move away from relying on counting the objects from one.

            <p>Give each child a collection of 10 or 12 counters that the children line up left to right on their desks.
                Tell them to count four counters and push them under their left hands or place them out of sight in a
                cup (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_03.xhtml#fig_8-6">Figure 8.6</a>). Then, pointing to the
                hidden counters in the child&#8217;s hand or cup, ask, &#8220;How many are there?&#8221; (Four.)
                &#8220;So let&#8217;s count like this: f-o-u-r (pronouncing the number slowing and pointing to their
                hand), five, six, . . . . &#8221; Repeat with other numbers of counters under the hand or in a cup.</p>

            <p>This game for two children requires a deck of cards (numbers 1 to 7), a die, a paper cup, and counters.
                The first player turns over the top number card and places the indicated number of counters in the cup.
                The card is placed next to the cup as a reminder of how many are inside. The second player rolls the die
                and places that many counters next to the cup. (See <a class="xref"
                    href="chapter0008_03.xhtml#fig_8-7">Figure 8.7</a>.) Together they decide how many counters in all.
                Give children the <a

                Cup,&#8221; &#8220;On the Side,&#8221; and &#8220;In All&#8221; to support their organization. Increase
                the highest number in the card deck when children have mastered the smaller numbers. For children with
                disabilities, keep the number of counters in the cup constant (such as five) and have them count on from
                that number until they are fluent. Then move to the full game.</p>

                href="chapter0008_03.xhtml#ch08-Activity-8-13">Activity 8.13</a>. Children who are not yet counting on
            may want to empty the counters from the cup or will count up from one using their fingers to keep track of
            the count. As children continue to play &#8220;Real Counting On,&#8221; they will eventually use counting on
            as that strategy becomes meaningful and useful.</p>
