            <h2 class="title">The Relations Core: More Than, Less Than, and Equal To</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The concepts of &#8220;more,&#8221; &#8220;less,&#8221; and &#8220;same&#8221; are basic relationships
            contributing to children&#8217;s overall understanding of number. Almost any child entering kindergarten can
            choose the set that is <em>more</em> if presented with two sets that are quite obviously different in
            number. In fact, <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_240" >Baroody (1987)</a> states,
            &#8220;A child unable to use &#8216;more&#8217; in this intuitive manner is at considerable education
            risk&#8221; (p. 29). Classroom activities should help children build on and refine this basic notion.</p>
        <p><span id="page124" class="pagebreak" title="124" />Although the concept of <em>less</em> is logically related
            to the concept of <em>more</em> (selecting the set with more is the same as <em>not</em> selecting the set
            with less), the concept of <em>less</em> proves to be more difficult for children than <em>more.</em> A
            possible explanation is that children have many opportunities to use the word <em>more</em> but have limited
            exposure to the word <em>less.</em> To help children with the concept, frequently pair the idea of
            <em>less</em> with <em>more</em> and make a conscious effort to ask &#8220;Which is less?&#8221; questions
            as well as &#8220;Which is more?&#8221; questions. In this way, the concept of <em>less</em> is connected
            with the better-known idea of <em>more</em> and children become familiar with the term.</p>
        <p>For all three concepts (more/greater than, less/less than, and same/equal to), children should construct sets
            using counters as well as make comparisons or choices between two given sets. Conduct the following
            activities in a spirit of inquiry with requests for children&#8217;s explanations: &#8220;Can you show me
            how you know this group has less?&#8221;</p>

                define the work space to support children with disabilities. Next to each picture card have children
                make three collections of counters: a set that is more than the amount in the picture, one that is less,
                and one that is the same. They then place the appropriate word card (<em>More</em>, <em>Less</em>,
                <em>Same</em>) on each of the sets (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_04.xhtml#fig_8-8">Figure
                    8.8</a>). Have children who struggle begin by creating a collection that matches the picture. Once
                they are consistently successful with creating a set that matches, move to creating sets with more and
                then to sets with less. For children who are ready to use symbols (&lt;, &gt;, = ) between the

        <p>Initially, when young children begin comparing sets, they may be easily confused by perceptual cues such as
            the length of the row of counters or the spacing of counters in one set versus another set. If needed,
            encourage children to use matching to compare sets. For example, in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0008_04.xhtml#ch08-Activity-8-14">Activity 8.14</a>, suggest that they stack counters on
            top of the images to match the sets.</p>

                and then find another card with the same amount to form a pair. Continue finding other pairs. This
                activity can be altered to have children find dot cards that are &#8220;less&#8221; or
                &#8220;more.&#8221; Some children with disabilities may need a set of counters with a blank ten-frame to
                help them &#8220;make&#8221; a pair instead of finding a pair.<span id="page125" class="pagebreak"

            <p>Observe children as they do these activities. Children whose number ideas are completely tied to counting
                and nothing more will select cards at random and count each dot. Others will begin by estimating and
                selecting a card that appears to have about the same number of dots. This demonstrates a significantly
                higher level of understanding. Also, observe how the dots are counted. Are the counts made accurately?
                Is each counted only once? Does the child touch the dot? A significant milestone for children occurs
                when they recognize small patterned sets without counting (subitizing).</p>

                into two separate decks. To play, one child draws a number card, places it face up, and puts that number
                of counters into a cup. Next, another child draws one of the more-or-less cards and places it next to
                the number card (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_04.xhtml#fig_8-9">Figure 8.9</a>). For the More
                cards, the designated number of counters are added to the cup; for the Less cards, counters are removed;
                and, for Zero cards, no change is made. Children then predict how many counters are in the cup. The
                counters are emptied and counted and then the game is repeated by drawing new cards. Eventually, the
                words <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> can be paired or substituted with <em>add</em> and
                <em>subtract</em> to connect these ideas with the arithmetic operations.</p>
