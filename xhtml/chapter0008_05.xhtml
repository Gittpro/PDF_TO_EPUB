        </header>
        <p><a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_251" >Howden (1989)</a> described <em>number
                sense</em> as a &#8220;good intuition about numbers and their relationships. It develops gradually as a
            result of exploring numbers, visualizing them in a variety of contexts, and relating them in ways that are
            not limited by traditional algorithms&#8221; (p. 11). <em>Principles and Standards for School
                Mathematics</em> <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_107" >(NCTM, 2000)</a>
            identifies the ability to think f lexibly about numbers, including various ways to represent and use
            numbers, as an indication of having number sense.</p>
        <p>In the remainder of this chapter, we look at the kinds of relationships and connections children should be
            making about smaller numbers up to about 20 to aid in their development of number sense. But &#8220;good
            intuition about numbers&#8221; does not end with these smaller whole numbers. Children continue to develop
            number sense as they <span id="page126" class="pagebreak" title="126" />use numbers in operations, build an
            understanding of place value, devise flexible methods of computing, and make estimates involving large
            numbers. Flexible, intuitive reasoning with numbers&#8212;number sense&#8212;should continue to be developed
            throughout the school years as fractions, decimals, and percentages are added to children&#8217;s repertoire
            of number ideas.</p>

            <h3 id="chap8-head3_4" class="title">Relationships between Numbers 1 through 10</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Once children have acquired the concept of cardinality and can meaningfully use their counting skills, they
            need to expand their collection of ideas about number sense to develop the knowledge needed to meaningfully
            work with operations. But too often teachers move directly from the beginning ideas of counting to addition
            and subtraction, leaving children with a very limited collection of ideas about number to bring to these new
            topics. We want children, as they solve problems, to move away from counting by ones and to develop
            strategies for mastering basic facts by emphasizing the development of number relationships such as those in
            <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#fig_8-10">Figure 8.10</a> and as follows:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p><em>One and two more, one and two less.</em> The two-more-than and two-less-than relationships
                    involve more than just the ability to count on two more or count back by two. Children should know
                    that 7, for example, is 1 more than 6 and also 2 less than 9.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Benchmark numbers of 5 and 10.</em> Because the number 10 plays such a large role in our
                    numeration system and because two fives equal 10, it is very useful to develop relationships between
                    the numbers 1 to 10 and the benchmark numbers of 5 and 10.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Part&#8211;part&#8211;whole relationships.</em> The most important relationship that can be
                    developed about numbers is to conceptualize a number as being composed of two or more parts. For
                    example, 7 can be thought of as a set of 3 and a set of 4 or a set of 2 and a set of 5.</p>
            </li>

            <p>The first relationship is titled, one more, slash, two more, slash, one less, slash, two less, and shows
                with a set of 3 numbers, 6, 7 and 9 with arrows above as follows, 6 to 7, 1 more; 7 to 9, 2 more; and
                arrows below the numbers as follows, 9 to 7, 2 less; and 7 to 6, 1 less. The second relationship is
                titled, benchmark numbers of 5 and 10. Five and three more is shown by two hands, one with five fingers
                open and the other has 3 fingers open. Two away from ten is shown by a ten frame with 8 counters. The
                third relationship is titled, part-part-whole. Six and three is nine, is shown by a domino with six dots
                on one side and 3 on the other side.</p>
        </details>
        <p>The principal tool that young children will use as they construct these relationships is the one number tool
            they possess: counting. Initially, you will notice a lot of counting by ones, and you may wonder if you are
            making progress. Have patience! As children construct new relationships and begin to use more powerful
            ideas, counting by ones will become less and less necessary.</p>

        </header>
        <p>When children count, they don&#8217;t automatically think about how one number is related to another. Their
            goal is only to match number words with objects until they reach the end of the count. To learn that six and
            eight are related by the corresponding relationships of &#8220;two more than&#8221; and &#8220;two less
            than&#8221; requires reflection on these ideas. Counting on (or back) one or two counts is a useful tool in
            constructing these ideas.<span id="page127" class="pagebreak" title="127" /></p>

                and, for each card, find a card that is two less than it. (Omit the 1 and 2 cards for two less than, and

            set. Children can be encouraged to take turns reading the associated number sentence to their partner. If,
            for example, a set has been made that is two more than a set of four, the child can say, &#8220;Two more
            than four equals six&#8221; or &#8220;Six is the same as two more than four.&#8221; The next activity moves
            to a purely symbolic representation of the relationships.</p>

                initially place their counters on the five-frame in any manner. For example, with four counters, a child
                may place two on each end and say, &#8220;It has a space in the middle&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s two

                counters are needed to make five. Next, try numbers between five and ten. As seen in <a class="xref"

        </aside>
        <p>Notice that the five-frame focuses on the relationship to five as a benchmark but does not help children
            relate numbers to ten. After five-frames have been used for a week or so, consider introducing ten-frames.
            Play a ten-frame version of a &#8220;Five-Frame Tell-About&#8221; but soon introduce the following
            convention for showing numbers on the ten-frame: <em>Always fill the top row first, starting on the left,
                the same way you read. When the top row is full, place counters in the bottom row, also from the
                left.</em> This approach will provide structure for seeing a full row in the ten-frame as five without
            the need to count, as can be seen in <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#fig_8-11">Figure 8.11</a>.
            At first, children may continue to count every counter by ones. So look for opportunities to draw
            children&#8217;s attention to this characteristic of the ten-frame. Make sure to spend time <span
                id="page129" class="pagebreak" title="129" />asking questions such as &#8220;What are you looking at in
            the ten-frame to help you find how many?&#8221; and &#8220;How does knowing you have a full row help you
            find how many?&#8221;</p>

            <p>You can find virtual activities with five- and ten-frames on NCTM&#8217;s Illuminations website. These
                versions allow children to build target numbers and include an option that asks children to determine
                how many counters are displayed as well as how many empty spaces are in a given frame. These activities
                can be used with individual learners as there is a voice-over option that will ask children questions

            <p>First, have all children make the same number on their <a
                        href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM13_Ten-Frame.pdf"
                        class="ulink">Ten-Frame</a> (Blackline Master 13). Then call out or hold up random
                numbers between 0 and 10. After each number, the children change their ten-frames to show the new
                number. Ask, &#8220;How do you decide how to change your ten-frame?&#8221; If working with English
                language learners (ELLs), consider saying the number in their native language or writing the number.
                Children can do this activity independently by using a prepared list of about 15 random numbers. One
                child plays &#8220;teacher&#8221; while the rest use the ten-frames.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>How children use the ten-frame provides insight into their current number concept development. Consequently,
            activities like this one can be used as a diagnostic interview. For example, when making a new number, some
            children will remove all the counters from the ten-frame and begin from a blank frame. Others will have
            learned what each number looks like and will soon learn to adjust numbers by adding on or taking off only
            what is required, often capitalizing on a row of five without counting. Do not pressure children to use one
            approach or another but have children share their strategies for how and why they make changes to the
            ten-frame.</p>
        <p>In the previous activity, encourage children to think about how their current number relates to the new
            number by having them tell, before changing their ten-frames, how many more counters need to be added
            (&#8220;plus&#8221;) or removed (&#8220;minus&#8221;). They then call out plus or minus whatever amount is
            appropriate. If, for example, the frames showed six, and the teacher called out &#8220;Four,&#8221; the
            children would respond &#8220;Minus two!&#8221; and then change their ten-frames accordingly. A discussion
            of how they know what to do is valuable. With continued experiences, all children can make new numbers on
            the ten-frame more efficiently.</p>

        <p>Ten-frame tasks are surprisingly challenging for children because there is a lot to keep in their working
            memory. Children must reflect on the two rows of five, the spaces remaining, and how a particular number is
            more or less than five and how far away it is from ten. How well children can respond to &#8220;Ten-Frame
            Flash&#8221; is a quick diagnostic assessment of their current number concept level. Consider interviews

            beads. You can also find a free electronic version of an arithmetic rack under the Math Learning
            Center&#8217;s free apps. In this e-version you can set the rack as a single row of 10 or create up to 10

                Relationships</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Any child who has learned how to count meaningfully can count out eight objects as you just did. What is
            significant about the experience is what it did <em>not</em> cause you to think about. Nothing in counting a
            set of eight objects will cause a child to focus on the fact that it could be made of two parts. For
            example, separate the counters you just set out into two piles and reflect on the combination. It might be 2
            and 6 or 7 and 1 or 4 and 4. Make a change in your two piles of counters and say the new combination to
            yourself. Focusing on a quantity in terms of its parts (<em>decomposing numbers)</em> has important
            implications for developing number sense. Of the three number relationships show in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#fig_8-10">Figure 8.10</a>, part-part-whole ideas are easily the most
            important. In fact, the ability to think about a number in terms of a <em>part-part-whole</em> relationship
            is a
            major milestone in the development of number sense.</p>
        <p>Most part&#8211;part&#8211;whole activities focus on a single number for the entire activity. For example,
            children might work on breaking apart or building the number 7 throughout an activity. They can either build
            (<em>compose</em>) the designated quantity in two or more parts (also known as a &#8220;both addends
            unknown&#8221; situation), or they start with the full amount and partition it into two or more parts

            reflective thought focused on the part&#8211;part&#8211;whole relationship. Writing can be in the form of
            drawings, numbers written in blanks (a group of _____ cubes and a group of _____ cubes), or addition

            <p>The task is to see, for a given number, how many different combinations children can make using two
                parts. (If you wish, you can allow for more than two parts.) Provide one type of material in different
                colors, such as connecting cubes or squares of colored paper. Use a context either from children&#8217;s
                daily lives that will be familiar to most or from a piece of children&#8217;s literature. For example,
                ask how many different combinations of six hats the peddler in the children&#8217;s book <em>Caps for
                    Sale</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_262" >Slobodkina, 1938</a>) can
                wear, limiting the color choices to two and keeping the colors together (i.e., three red and three blue
                caps, four red and two blue, etc.). (Note that the book is also available in Spanish for some ELLs and
                may be found as a YouTube video.) Each different combination can be displayed on a small mat. Have
                children say or read, and eventually write, a number sentence that matches their partner&#8217;s

        <p>In the &#8220;Build It in Parts&#8221; activity, the children are focusing on the combinations. To add some
            interest, vary the activity by adding a design component. Rather than creating a two-part illustration for a
            number, children create an interesting design with an assigned number of elements. For each design, they are
            then challenged to see and read the design in two parts. Here are some ideas.</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>

            <li>
                <p>Make designs with f lat toothpicks. These can be dipped in white glue and placed on small squares of
                    cardstock to create a permanent record.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make designs with touching squares or triangles. Cut a large supply of small squares or triangles out

            <p>4 examples of representations for six are shown. Wooden cubes have a set of 4 and 2, a set of 3 and 3,
                and a set of 1 and 2 and 3 or 3 and 3. Pattern blocks have a group of 4 rhombuses and 2 triangles that
                show 6 as a group of 4 and 2, and a group of 2 and 2 and 2. A second set of pattern blocks has a hexagon
                connected to a group of 3 trapezoids, which are then connected to 2 additional trapezoids to show six as
                a group of 1 and 3 and 2, and a group of 1 and 5. Three sets of 6 toothpicks. The first set is two
                verticals of two toothpicks connected by two single toothpicks horizontally to show six as 4 and 2 or 3
                and 3. the second set has a single toothpick with five toothpicks extending from one end to show 5 and
                1. The third set has 3 groups of 2 toothpicks, each meeting on one end. a representation with squared
                has two rows of 3 connected squares to show 3 and 3. A second representation with squares has touching

        <p>You can also use children&#8217;s literature to provide contexts for part-part-whole activities. For example,
            <em>10 Little Hot Dogs</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_250" >Himmelman,
                2010</a>), a predictable-progression counting book, features 10 dachshund puppies climbing on and off a
            chair. Using a mat illustrated with a <a

                    class="ulink">Chair</a> and counters representing the puppies, children can show different
            ways to put, say, six puppies on and off the chair. Two children can compare the numbers of puppies on their
            chairs. Who has more puppies on their chair? How many more?</p>
        <p><a class="xref" href="#ch08-Activity-8-24">Activity 8.24</a> is a quick part&#8211;part&#8211;whole activity

            <p><span id="page133" class="pagebreak" title="133" />Tell children their task is to hold up a given number
                of fingers when you state the number. For example, ask them to hold up five fingers. Initially, children
                may just show five fingers on one hand. Encourage them to think of different ways they can hold up five
                fingers (e.g., two on one hand, three on the other; four on one hand, one on the other). Ask children
                questions to encourage them to think about the commutative property. For example, &#8220;Kane is showing
                two on his right hand and three on his left hand. Rina is showing three on her right hand and two on her
                left hand. How are those different? How are they the same?&#8221;</p>
        </aside>
        <p>An important variation of part&#8211;part&#8211;whole activities is referred to as <em>missing-part</em>
            activities. In a missing-part activity, children are given the whole amount and part of the whole. They then
            use their already developed knowledge of the parts of that whole to try to tell what the covered or hidden
            part is. If they are unsure, they simply uncover the unknown part and say the full combination. Missing-part
            activities can be challenging for children not only because the missing part increases the difficulty level
            but also because they encourage children to continue to reflect on the combinations for a number. They also
            serve as the forerunner to subtraction. With a whole of eight but with only three showing, the child can
            later learn to write &#8220;<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

        <p>The next four activities illustrate variations of this important idea of a missing part. For any of these
            activities you can use a context from familiar classroom events or from a children&#8217;s book, such as the
            animals hiding in the barn in <em>Hide and Seek</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_263"

                create nine cards with the visible part ranging from 0 to 8 dots. Children use the cards as in
                &#8220;Covered Parts,&#8221; saying, &#8220;Four and two is six&#8221; for a card with four dots showing
                and two dots hiding under the flap (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#fig_8-16">Figure

                &#8220;I wish I had six.&#8221; The children respond with the part that is needed to make six. Counting
                on can be used to check. The game can focus on the same &#8220;I wish I had&#8221; number (a good
                starting point for children with disabilities), or the number can change each time (see <a class="xref"

                have found at least 10 pairs, the next challenge is for the partner to name the number on the other
                side. The cards are turned over to confirm. The same sandwiches can then be used again to name the other
                hidden part.</p>

            <p>You can also incorporate digital formats for any of the preceding part-part-whole activities. All you
                need is a program that permits children to create sets of objects on the screen. Look at Scott
                Foresman&#8217;s eTools and choose &#8220;Counters.&#8221; Under &#8220;work-spaces&#8221; on the bottom
                left, select the bucket icon and then pick the bathtub and add boat, duck, or goldfish counters. As
                shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#fig_8-17">Figure 8.17(a)</a>, children can stamp
                different bathtub toys either in the bathtub (unseen) or outside the tub. The numeral on the bathtub
                shows how many are in the tub, or it can show a question mark (?) for missing-part thinking. The total
                is shown at the bottom. By clicking on the light bulb, the contents of the bathtub can be seen, as shown
                in <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#fig_8-17">Figure 8.17(b)</a>. This program offers a great
                opportunity to develop both part&#8211;part&#8211;whole and missing-part concepts.</p>

            <p>To assess part&#8211;part&#8211;whole relationships, use a missing-part diagnostic interview (similar to
                <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#ch08-Activity-8-25">Activity 8.25</a> &#8220;Covered
                Parts&#8221;). Begin with a number you believe the child has &#8220;mastered,&#8221; such as 5. Have the
                child count out that many counters into your open hand. Close your hand around the counters and confirm
                that child knows how many are hidden there. Then remove some and show them in the open palm of your
                other hand. (See <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_05.xhtml#fig_8-18">Figure 8.18</a>.) Ask the child,
                &#8220;How many are hidden?&#8221; Repeat with different amounts removed, checking three or four missing
                parts for each number. If the child responds quickly and correctly and is clearly not counting in any
                way, call that a &#8220;mastered number&#8221; and check it off the child&#8217;s assessment record.
                Repeat the process with the next higher number. Continue until the child begins to struggle. In early
                kindergarten you will find a range of mastered numbers from four to eight. By the end of kindergarten,
                children should have mastered numbers up to 10 (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242"
