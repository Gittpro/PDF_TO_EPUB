        </header>
        <p>Although preK, kindergartners, and first-graders experience numbers up to 20 and beyond daily, it should not
            be assumed that they will automatically extend the set of relationships they developed with smaller numbers
            to numbers beyond 10. And yet these numbers play a big part in many counting activities, in basic facts, and
            in much of what we do with mental computation. In fact, several researchers suggest number instruction
            should move beyond 10 and even beyond 20 as soon as possible&#8212;even before formal place-value
            instruction (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_247" >Fosnot &amp; Dolk, 2001</a>;
            Wright, Stranger, Stafford, &amp; Martland, 2006). Although children may count by ones to count sets beyond
            10, the experiences of counting and grouping help children build important initial place-value knowledge. The
            emphasis should be on helping children learn the number words and numerals beyond 10 rather than the
            traditional notions of place value (e.g., names of places). That will come in time as children develop
            strategies to add and subtract two-digit numbers.</p>

            <p>Say to yourself, &#8220;One ten.&#8221; Now think about that from the perspective of a child just
                learning to count to 20! What could one ten possibly mean when ten tells me how many fingers I have and
                is the number that comes after nine? How can it be one?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Wright and his colleagues (2006) outlined a three-level progression of children&#8217;s understanding of ten:
        </p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p><em>An initial concept of ten.</em> The child understands ten as ten ones and does not see ten as a
                    unit. When children at this level work on a task involving tens, they will count by ones.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>An intermediate concept of ten.</em> The child understands ten as a unit composed of ten ones but
                    relies on materials or representations to help complete tasks involving tens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>A facile concept of ten.</em> The child can solve tasks involving tens and ones without using
                    materials or representations. At this level children can mentally think about two-digit numbers as
                    groups of tens and ones.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><span id="page137" class="pagebreak" title="137" />
            The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> suggests that first-graders should know that &#8220;10 can be
            thought of as a bundle of ten ones&#8212;called a &#8216;ten:&#8217; &#8221; (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242" >CCSSO, 2010</a>, p. 15). The difficulty of
            children understanding &#8220;one ten and six ones&#8221; (what&#8217;s a one?) does not mean that a set of
            ten should not figure prominently in the discussion of the teen numbers. To help children move their
            understanding of &#8220;ten&#8221; forward, consider providing lots of purposeful opportunities for them to
            count and group objects. For example, <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_247" >Fosnot
                and Dolk (2001)</a> describe a K&#8211;1 teacher who used the context of making necklaces using five
            beads of one color, then five beads of another color, and then repeating these groups of five. Children
            could count by ones if they needed to, but the teacher built in the constraint of creating necklaces with a
            five structure to encourage the children to begin to count by fives. Eventually she introduced the idea of
            selling the necklaces as a school fundraiser and suggested charging a penny per bead. Because the beads were
            in groups of five, the children worked with nickels and dimes, further encouraging the children to begin to
            see five and ten as units.
        </p>
        <p>Initially, children do not see a numeric pattern in the numbers between 10 and 20. Rather, these number names
            are simply ten additional words in the number sequence. Building from the idea mentioned earlier, mapping
            the teens number names to a ten and one structure is an important idea (i.e., matching thirteen to
            &#8220;ten and three&#8221;). The activity that follows provides a way to help children visualize and
            reinforce the meaning of &#8220;teen&#8221; numbers.</p>

            <p>Use a simple two-part mat and a story that links to whatever counters you are using. Then have children
                count out ten counters (e.g., bears, beans, coffee stirrers, etc.) onto the left side of the mat. Next
                have them put five counters on the other side. Together, count all of the counters by ones. Chorus the
                combination: &#8220;Ten and five equals fifteen.&#8221; Turn the mat around: &#8220;Five and ten equals
                fifteen.&#8221; Repeat with other numbers in a random order but always start with the ten on the left
                side of the mat. After children have had some experience with this activity, bundle the counters (with a
                rubber band or plastic baggie) into groups of ten.</p>

        <p>&#8220;Ten and Some More&#8221; is designed to teach the numbers in the &#8220;teens&#8221; and, thus,
            requires some explicit teaching. Watch this <strong>video</strong> (<a

            children show numbers to 20 on their frames. Have children discuss how the counters can be arranged on the
            Double Ten-Frame mat so that it is easy to see how many are there. At first, not every child will create a
            full set of 10, but as this idea becomes more popular, they will develop the notion that teens are 10 and
            some more. Eventually challenge children to show larger amounts, such as 26 counters or even more. In this
            video called <strong>Beyond Fingers</strong> (<a

                For example, write a two-digit number, say, 16, where children can see it. Children are to find the two
                cards that can be used to make 16 (a 10 and a 6). Select children to demonstrate to the class how to
                make the given number. Point out that you can still see the 10 hiding under the overlay of the 6. Repeat
                the activity with different two-digit numbers. When children are ready, extend the activity to
                three-digit numbers. You can also have children represent the numbers with concrete materials, such as
                base-ten materials or ten-frames.</p>

        <p>According to the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>), kindergartners are expected to be able to count to 100 by
            the end of the school year. Therefore, early exposure to numbers to 100 is important. Although it is
            unlikely that children in kindergarten or first grade will initially have a facile understanding of tens and
            ones related to place value, they should learn much about the sequence of numbers and counting patterns to
            100, if not beyond.</p>

            (see Blackline Master 3). Children can orally count to 100 as you or a child points to each number on the
            chart. Whenever collections of things are counted, it is a good idea to pause long enough to find the number
            on the chart. This can help put numbers for large quantities in perspective. Point out, for example, that 87
            is a big number that is close to 100. The number 35 is also big but is closer to 20 than 100 and is far away
            from 87.</p>

                <p>In a row, one number &#8220;counts&#8221; (the ones digit goes 1, 2, 3, . . ., 9, 0); the
                    &#8220;first&#8221; number (tens digit) stays the same but the &#8220;second&#8221; number (ones
                    digit) goes up by ones.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a column, the first number (tens digit) &#8220;counts&#8221; or goes up by ones.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can count by tens going down the right-hand column.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you count by fives, you get two columns: the 5 column and the last column.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The number right above a given number is 10 less; the number right below a given number is 10 more.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For children, these patterns are not at all obvious or trivial. For example, one child may notice the pattern
            in the column under the 4&#8212;every number ends in a 4. Two minutes later <span id="page140"
                class="pagebreak" title="140" />another child will &#8220;discover&#8221; the parallel pattern in the
            column headed by 7. That there is a pattern like this in every column may not be completely obvious.</p>
        <p>Knowing the number sequence up to 100 by 10s is a kindergarten expectation in the Common Core and
            skip-counting by 5s, 10s, and 100s is a second grade expectation. Keep in mind that children commonly learn
            number sequences before they consider the value of the number words. Watch a video of <a
                    href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/0188" class="ulink">Nicole</a>, a second
            grader who skip counts by 10s up to 100. It is not until she is asked, &#8220;What comes after 100&#8221;
            and she responds, &#8220;200&#8221; that you realize that she may not be considering the meaning of the
            10-count and the value of the number words. The hundreds chart is a useful tool to help children explore
            skip-count patterns. However, they will need additional work to ensure they are also considering the value
            of the numbers in the skip count sequence.</p>
        <p>The next activity challenges children to use the patterns they have noticed and discussed in <a class="xref"

            <p>Provide children with a hundreds chart on which some of the number cards have been removed. (One option
                is to use a classroom pocket chart. Another option is to fill in parts of an empty hundreds chart
                <a
                        href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM2_Blank_Hundreds_Chart.pdf"
                        class="ulink">Blackline Master 2</a>). The children&#8217;s task is to replace the
                missing numbers in the chart. Beginning versions of this activity have only a random selection of
                individual numbers removed. Later, remove sequences of several numbers from three or four different
                rows. Finally, remove all but one or two rows or columns. Eventually, challenge children to replace all
                of the numbers in a blank chart. If you use a classroom hundreds chart, provide children with
                disabilities their own copy using an empty hundreds chart. Having their own copy allows them to write
                possible numbers in the missing spots on the chart so they do not have to keep the numbers in short term
                memory. This allows them to focus on the more cognitively demanding task of reasoning about the numbers
                and their relationships.

            <p>Replacing the number cards or tiles from a blank chart is a good learning center activity for two
                children to work on together. By listening to how children go about finding the correct locations for
                numbers, you can learn a lot about how well they have constructed an understanding of the 1-to-100
                sequence.</p>
