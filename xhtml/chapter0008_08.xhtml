</header>
<p>One of the best ways for children to think of real quantities is to associate numbers with measures of things. In the early grades, measures of length, weight, and time are good places to begin. Just measuring and recording results will not be very effective unless there is a meaningful reason for children to be interested in or to think about the result. To help children think about the numbers in a context and what they mean (e.g., how long the desk is, how heavy the book is), ask them to first write down or tell you an estimate. To produce an estimate is, however, a very difficult task for young children. They do not easily grasp the concept of &#8220;estimate&#8221; or &#8220;about.&#8221; So children need lots of opportunities to explore what is meant by &#8220;estimate&#8221; and &#8220;about.&#8221; As an example, suppose that you have cut out an ample supply of very large footprints, each about 18-inches long. You would ask the class, &#8220;About how many of the giant&#8217;s footprints will it take to measure across the rug in our reading corner?&#8221; The key word here is <em>about,</em> and it is one that you will need to spend a lot of time helping your children understand. To this end, the request for an estimate can be made in ways that help develop the concept of <em>about.</em> For example, rather than asking children for a specific number, begin by asking whether the amount will be more or less than a target number. The following questions can be used with most early estimation activities:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p><em>More or less than</em> ________? Will the rug be more or less than 10 footprints long? Will the apple weigh more or less than 20 blocks? Are there more or less than 15 connecting cubes in this long bar?</p>

</aside>
</li>
<li><p><em>Closer to</em> ________ <em>or to</em> ________? Will the rug be closer to 5 footprints or closer to 20 footprints long? Will the apple weigh closer to 10 blocks or closer to 30 blocks? Does this bar have closer to 10 cubes or closer to 50 cubes?</p></li>
<li><p><em>About</em> ________? About how many footprints long is the rug? About how many blocks will the apple weigh? About how many cubes are in this bar? (You can suggest possible numbers as options.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Asking for estimates using these formats helps children learn what you mean by <em>about</em>. Every child can make an estimate with some supportive questions and examples. However, rewarding children for the closest estimate in a competitive fashion will often result in their <span id="page142" class="pagebreak" title="142"/>trying to seek precision and not actually estimate. Instead, discuss all answers that fall into a reasonable range. One of the best approaches is to give children ranges as their possible answers: &#8220;Does your estimate fall between 10 and 30? Between 50 and 70? Or 100 and 130?&#8221; Of course, you can make the choices more divergent until they grasp the idea.</p>
<p>To help with numbers and measures, estimate several things in succession using the same unit. For example, suppose that you are estimating and measuring &#8220;around things&#8221; using a string. The string is wrapped around the object and then measured in some unit such as popsicle sticks. After measuring the distance around Demetria&#8217;s head, estimate the distance around the wastebasket or around the globe or around George&#8217;s wrist. Each successive measure helps children with the new estimates. See <a class="xref" href="chapter0015_00.xhtml">Chapter 15</a> for a complete discussion of measurement.</p>
<p>Here are some activities that can help children connect numbers to real situations.

<p>Write a number on the board. Now suggest some units to go with it, and ask the children what comes to mind when they hear the number and unit. For example, suppose the number is 9. &#8220;What do you think of when I say 9 <em>dollars</em>? 9 <em>hours</em>? 9 <em>cars</em>? 9 <em>kids</em>? 9 <em>meters</em>? 9 <em>o&#8217;clock</em>? 9 <em>hand spans</em>? 9 <em>gallons</em>?&#8221; Spend some time discussing and exploring each unit. Let children suggest other appropriate units. Children from different cultures may be able to share different units used in their culture.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: K.MD.A.1; 1.MD.A.2; 2.MD.A.3</strong></p>
<p>Select a number and a unit&#8212;for example, 15 feet. Could the teacher be 15 feet tall? Could a house be 15 feet wide? Can a man jump 15 feet high? Could three children stretch their arms 15 feet? Pick any number, large or small, and a unit with which children are familiar. Then make up a series of these questions. Also ask, &#8220;How can we find out if it is reasonable or not? Who has an idea about what we can do?&#8221; When children are familiar with this activity, have them select the number and unit and create the questions to ask.</p>

<p>These activities are problem based in the truest sense. Not only are there no clear answers, but children can easily begin to pose their own questions and explore the numbers and units most interesting to them. You can also use the Toy Shop activities at the NCTM Illuminations website as a setting that focuses on finding numbers in the real world.</p>
