<p>Graphing activities are good ways to connect children&#8217;s worlds with number and relationships.
(<a class="xref" href="chapter0017_00.xhtml">Chapter 17</a> discusses ways to make graphs with children in grades pre K&#8211;2.) Graphs can be quickly made from any data gathered with children: favorites (ice cream flavor, color, sports team, type of pet); number of sisters, brothers, pets; transportation modes to school; <span id="page143" class="pagebreak" title="143"/>types of shoes children are wearing (sneakers, sandals, etc.); and so on. Graphs can be connected to content in other subjects, such as an investigation of objects that float or sink. Or a unit on sea life might lead to a graph of favorite sea animals. Here are some other options for graphs that are linked to children&#8217;s literature:
</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p><em>Chrysanthemum</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_249" >Henkes, 2008</a>)<em>:</em> Create a graph of the length of children&#8217;s first names (i.e., use categories 3, 4, 5 letters and so on).</p></li>
<li><p><em>This is the Way We Go to School</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_239" >Baer, 1990</a>)<em>:</em> Make a graph of the way children come to school.</p></li>
<li><p><em>We&#8217;re Going on a Leaf Hunt</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_257" >Metzger, 2008</a>)<em>:</em> Have children collect a leaf from around their home or around the school, create a graph of different types of leaves.</p></li>
<li><p><em>3 Little Firefighters</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_258" >Murphy, 2003</a>)<em>:</em> Use children&#8217;s career aspirations to make a graph (i.e., sort jobs into public service, entertainment, education, and so on).
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the early stages of number development, the use of graphs is primarily for developing number relationships and for connecting numbers to real quantities in the children&#8217;s environment. The graphs focus attention on counts of realistic things. Once a graph is made, it is very important to take the time to ask questions (e.g., &#8220;What do you notice about the ice cream choices our class made?&#8221; &#8220;How many more children ride the bus to school than come in cars?&#8221;). Equally important, graphs can elicit comparisons between numbers that are rarely made when only one number or quantity is considered at a time. See <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_09.xhtml#fig_8-22">Figure 8.22</a> for an example of a graph and corresponding questions. At first, children may find it challenging to respond to questions involving differences, but these comparison concepts add considerably to children&#8217;s understanding of number and are a focus of 1.MD.C.4 in the Common Core State Standards (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_242" >CCSSO, 2010</a>).</p>

<p>The class graph showing fruit brought for snack has square paper cutouts for bananas, oranges, apples, and cards for others with words written for grapes, none and 2 with peach. The graph has a vertical axis with numbers in increments of 1, and horizontal axis labeled bananas, oranges, apples and other. Cards are stacked on the horizontal axis above the corresponding label, 3 banana cards, 6 orange cards, 9 apple cards and the 4 written cards stacked above each other. Questions to the side of the graph, with blank spaces to fill in, are as follows. Which snack, or refer to what the graph represents, is most, least? Which are more, less, than 7, or some other number? Which is one less, more, than this snack, or use fruit name? How much more is blank than blank? Follow this question immediately by reversing the order and asking how much less. How much less is blank than blank? Reverse this question after receiving an answer. How much difference is there between blank and blank? Which two bars together are the same as blank?</p>
