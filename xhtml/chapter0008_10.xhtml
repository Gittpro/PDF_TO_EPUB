                Revisiting the Big Ideas for Number Concepts</h2>
        </header>
        <p>As a recap of the big ideas from this chapter, here is a list of the kinds of things that children should
            learn about the number 8 (or any number up to about 20) while they are in pre K and kindergarten:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Count to 8 (know the number words and their order)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Count 8 objects and know that the last number word tells how many</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Recognize, read, and write the numeral 8 and pair it with an amount of objects</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>State more and less by 1 and 2&#8212;8 is one more than 7, one less than 9, two more than 6, and two
                    less than 10</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Recognize patterned sets for 8 such as:</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="figure lc_img33 fx-lightbox">
            <img class="fx-lightbox preventTap" alt="A set of 8 counters are in two horizontal rows of 4 counters each."
                src="../images/unfig08-01.png"></img>
        </figure>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Relate to the benchmark numbers of 5 and 10: 8 is 3 more than 5 and 2 away from 10
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>State part&#8211;part&#8211;whole relationships: 8 is the same as 5 and 3, 2 and 6, 7 and 1, and so
                    on (this includes knowing the missing part of 8 when some are hidden)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Identify doubles: double 4 equals 8</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>State relationships to the real world: my brother is 8 years old; my reading book is 8 inches wide
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>First and second graders extend these ideas to numbers beyond ten and further refine their understanding of
            number:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>One ten is equal to ten ones</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fifteen is composed of ten and five more</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>632 is composed of 600 and 30 and 2 more</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Benchmark numbers of 5 and 10 can be used for mental computation with larger numbers: think of <math

                <p>Larger numbers are related to the real world: there are 457 children in my school; we drove almost
                    900 miles over summer vacation</p>

        </ul>
        <p>We started the chapter sharing findings from research that underscore the importance of young children
            developing strong number sense. We end the chapter by providing a summary of common misconceptions and
            errors children make when they are learning about number concepts along with ways you can help (see <a
                class="xref" href="#Tab_8-2">Table 8.2</a>). Being aware of these common misconceptions will allow you
            to anticipate and recognize them in your children so you can purposefully address the misconceptions with
            instruction and ultimately support children to develop a rich and flexible understanding of number that will
            serve them well in mathematics and in life.<span id="page145" class="pagebreak" title="145" /></p>

                                    want to peek at the collection. Encourage child to think about how many before
