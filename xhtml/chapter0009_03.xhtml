        </header>
        <p>Addition and subtraction situations have been studied extensively and categorized in multiple ways (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_283" >Gutstein &amp; Romberg, 1995</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_269" >Carpenter, Fennema, Franke, Levi, &amp;
                Empson, 2014</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_300" >Verschaffel, Greer,
                &amp; De Corte, 2007</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_274" >Clements &amp;
                Sarama, 2009</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_288" >NRC, 2009</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1</a> illustrates one categorization scheme that identifies
            four types of problems based on the relationships involved. These problem types include <em>change</em>
            problems (<em>join</em> and <em>separate</em>), <em>part&#8211;part&#8211;whole</em> problems, and
            <em>compare</em> problems (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_269" >Carpenter,
                Fennema, Franke, Levi, &amp; Empson, 2014</a>). Each structure has three numbers. For example, the
            <em>Join</em> problem type has a start number, a change number, and a result number. The
            <em>Part&#8211;part&#8211;whole</em> problem type has two part numbers and one whole. Any one or more of the
            three numbers can be unknown in a story problem.<span id="page149" class="pagebreak" title="149" /></p>

        </aside>
        <p>In <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1</a>, each of the problem types and
            structures are illustrated with a story problem that uses the number family 4, 8, 12. Depending on which of
            the three quantities is unknown, a different problem structure results. Note that the problems are described
            in terms of their type and structure and not as addition or subtraction problems. Contrary to what you may
            have thought, a joining action does not always mean addition, nor does separate or remove always mean
            subtraction, as can be seen in the number sentences in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1</a>.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Join/Add To Problems</h4>
        </header>
        <p><em>Join</em> problems describe situations in which quantities are physically being brought together. These
            problems are also known as <em>add to</em> problems because the action or change occurring in the problem is
            a result of adding or joining quantities. For joining problems, <span id="page150" class="pagebreak"
                title="150" />there are three quantities involved: an initial or <em>start amount</em>, a <em>change
                amount</em> (the part being added or joined), and the <em>resulting amount</em> (the total amount after
            the change takes place). In <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1(a)</a>, this is
            illustrated by the change being &#8220;added&#8221; to the start amount. Provide children the <a

            <h4 class="title">Separate/Take From Problems</h4>
        </header>
        <p><em>Separate</em> problems are commonly known as <em>take away</em> or <em>take from</em> problems in which
            part of a quantity is physically being removed or taken away. Notice that in the <em>separate</em> problems,
            the start amount is the whole or the largest amount, whereas in the <em>join</em> problems, the result is
            the largest amount (the whole). Children can use the <a
