<p><em>Part&#8211;part&#8211;whole</em> problems, also known as <em>put together</em> and <em>take apart</em> problems in the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270" >CCSSO, 2010</a>), involve two parts that are conceptually or mentally combined into one collection or whole, as in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1(c)</a>. These problems are different from <em>change</em> problems in that there is no action of physically joining or separating the quantities. In these situations, either the missing whole (total unknown), one of the missing parts (one addend unknown), or both parts (two addends unknown) must be found. There is no meaningful distinction between the two parts in a part&#8211;part&#8211;whole situation, so there is no need to have a different problem for each part as the unknown. The third situation in which the whole or total is known and the two parts are unknown creates opportunities to think about all the possible decompositions of the whole. This structure links directly to the idea that numbers are embedded in other numbers (part of the Number Core). For example, children can break apart 7 into 5 and 2, where each of the addends (or parts) is embedded in the 7 (whole). These kinds of problems can conceptually combine different kinds of objects, such as 5 red balls and 6 blue balls or 3 cars and 4 trucks, into one collection. Combining different kinds of objects into one set can be challenging for young children to understand because they have to generalize what the different objects have in common.
