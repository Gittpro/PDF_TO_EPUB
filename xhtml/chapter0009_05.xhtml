        <p>Compare problems involve the comparison of two quantities. The third amount in these problems does not
            actually exist but is the <em>difference</em> between the two quantities (see <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1(d)</a>). Like part&#8211;part&#8211;whole problems,
            comparison situations do not typically involve a physical action. The corresponding <a
                    href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Compare_Story.pdf"
                    class="ulink">Compare Story</a> Activity Page can help children model the situation. The
            unknown quantity in compare problems can be one of three quantities: the smaller amount, the larger amount,
            or the difference. For each of these situations, two examples are provided: one problem in which the
            difference is stated in terms of &#8220;how many more?&#8221; and the other in terms of &#8220;how many
            less?&#8221; Note that the language of &#8220;more&#8221; and &#8220;less&#8221; can present a challenge to
            many children as they attempt to interpret the relationships between the quantities using these ideas.</p>
        <p>You can find more examples of compare problems as well as the other problem types in the <em>Common Core
                State Standards</em> (see Table 1 in the CCSSI Math Standards Glossary; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270" >CCSSO, 2010</a>, p. 88).<span id="page151"

            <p>Go back through the example story problems in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table
                    9.1</a> and match the numbers in the problems with the components of the structures. For example,
                which numbers in the Join Problems match to start, change, and result and which are unknown? For each
                problem, if possible, first print off the corresponding graphic organizer Activity Page, and second, use
                a set of counters or coins to model (solve) the problem as you think children in the primary grades
                might do. Write either an addition or subtraction equation that you think best represents the problem as
                you did it with counters and then compare your equation to the ones in <a class="xref"
                    href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1</a>. If you did not use a listed equation, try to
                recreate the reasoning that could result in that equation.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>As you look back at the equations for each of the problems in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1</a>, you may have written some equations where the unknown
            quantity is not isolated on one side of the equal sign. For example, a likely equation for the join problem
            with start unknown is <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
                altimg="../images/render56.png" alttext="square plus 4 equals 12" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250"
                class="informalequation">
                <mrow>
                    <mn>&#9633;</mn>
                    <mo>+</mo>
                    <mn>4</mn>
                    <mo>=</mo>
                    <mn>12</mn>
                </mrow>
            </math>. This is referred to as the <em>semantic</em> equation for the problem because the numbers are
            listed in the order that follows the sequence of the story problem. When the semantic form does not isolate
            the unknown on one side of the equation, an equivalent equation can be written for the same problem. In this
            case, for <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render56.png"
                alttext="square plus 4 equals 12" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation">
                <mrow>
                    <mn>&#9633;</mn>
                    <mo>+</mo>
                    <mn>4</mn>
                    <mo>=</mo>
                    <mn>12</mn>
                </mrow>
            </math>, we can write the equivalent equation <math display="inline"
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render57.png"
                alttext="12 minus 4 equals square" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation">
                <mrow>
                    <mn>12</mn>
                    <mo>&#8722;</mo>
                    <mn>4</mn>
                    <mo>=</mo>

                </mrow>
            </math> (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_05.xhtml#fig_9-1">Figure 9.1</a>). This is referred to as the
            <em>computational</em> form of the equation; it isolates the unknown and is typically how most older
            students and adults think about the problem. This may be an efficient way to solve the problem, but children
            typically begin to think about and model the situation based on the sequence played out in the problem,
            which is modeled more appropriately by the semantic equation&#8212;and this way of reasoning should be
            valued. When the semantic form is not also the computational form, help children see how these equations are
            equivalent and that there are several equivalent equations to represent a given situation. The structure of
            the equations also may cause difficulty for English language learners (ELLs), who may not initially have the
            flexibility in creating equivalent equations due to reading comprehension issues with the story situation.

        <p>The categories in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_03.xhtml#tab_9-1">Table 9.1</a> help children develop a
            schema to identify important information and to structure their thinking. In particular, researchers suggest
            that children (particularly those with disabilities) should be explicitly taught these underlying structures
            so that they can identify important characteristics of the situations and determine when to add or subtract
            (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_280" >Fagnant &amp; Vlassis, 2013</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_282" >Fuchs, Fuchs, Prentice, Hamlett, Finelli,
                &amp; Courey, 2004</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_302" >Xin, Jitendra,
                &amp; Deatline-Buchman, 2005</a>). When children are exposed to new problems, the familiar
            characteristics will assist them in generalizing from similar problems on which they have practiced.
            Furthermore, teachers who are not aware of the variety of situations <span id="page152" class="pagebreak"
                title="152" />and corresponding structures may randomly offer problems to children without the proper
            sequencing to support their full grasp of the meaning of the operations. By knowing the logical structure of
            these problems, you will be able to help children interpret a variety of real-world contexts. More
            importantly, you will need to pose a variety of problem types with different structures (i.e., unknowns) as
            well as recognize which types and structures produce the greatest challenge for children&#8212;the topic of
            the next section.</p>
