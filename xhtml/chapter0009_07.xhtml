        <p>Combining the use of the story problem structures and models (counters, drawings, number lines, bar diagrams)
            is important in helping children construct a deep understanding of addition and subtraction. Building the
            understanding of these operations now will support children&#8217;s understanding of these operations with
            larger numbers, fractions, and decimals later on. As you read this next section, note that addition and
            subtraction are taught at the same time.</p>

        <p>There is more to think about than simply giving children problems to solve. In contrast with the rather
            straightforward and brief contextual problems in the previous section, consider the following problem, which
            a child has solved in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_07.xhtml#fig_9-2">Figure 9.2</a>.</p>

        <p><a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_281" >Fosnot and Dolk (2001)</a> point out that in
            story problems, children tend to focus on getting the answer. &#8220;Context problems, by contrast, are
            connected as closely as possible to children&#8217;s <span id="page154" class="pagebreak"
                title="154" />lives, rather than to &#8216;school mathematics.&#8217; They are designed to anticipate
            and to develop children&#8217;s mathematical modeling of the real world&#8221; (p. 24). Contextual problems
            might derive from recent experiences in the classroom; a field trip; a discussion in art, science, or social
            studies; or from children&#8217;s literature. Because contextual problems connect to life experiences, they
            are important for ELLs, too, even though it may seem that the language presents a challenge to them. Some
            strategies to support comprehension of contextual problems include using a noun-verb word order, replacing
            terms such as &#8220;his/her&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8221; with a name, and removing unnecessary words. A
            visual aid, or having actual children model this story, would also be effective strategies for ELLs and
            children with disabilities. As an example, the preceding problem could be rewritten as:</p>

        <p><em>Bedtime Math</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_289" >Overdeck, 2013</a>) is
            a series of books (with an accompanying website) that is the author&#8217;s attempt to get parents to
            incorporate math problems into the nighttime (or daytime) routine. There are three levels of difficulty,
            starting with problems for &#8220;wee ones&#8221; (preK), &#8220;little kids&#8221; (K&#8211;2), and
            &#8220;big kids&#8221; (grade 2 and up). Each set of problems revolves around a high-interest topic such as
            roller coasters, foods, and animals. Teachers can use these problems in class for engaging children in
            interesting contextual problems.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Wording of Problems</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Contextual and story problems that are worded so that the actions and quantities f low in a chronological or
            natural story order are generally easier than those in which the order is inverted. For example, in the
            following pair of story problems, the natural order of events in the second problem is easier for children
            to follow:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_06">
            <p>Mike&#8217;s grandpa gave him some money for his birthday. Mike already had 6 dollars. Now Mike has 9
                dollars. How much money did Mike&#8217;s grandpa give him?</p>
        </aside>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_07">
            <p>Mike had 6 dollars. His grandpa gave him some money for his birthday. Now he has 9 dollars. How much
                money did Mike&#8217;s grandpa give him?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Join problems with the change unknown can be thought of in terms of &#8220;how much more is needed&#8221; or
            &#8220;how much was added.&#8221; Some children find story problems with actions that happened in the past
            more difficult to process and so would find the first of the following two problems easier:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_08">
            <p>Joyce has 3 eggs in her basket. How many more eggs does she need to find to have 8 eggs?</p>
        </aside>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_09">
            <p><span id="page155" class="pagebreak" title="155" />Joyce has 3 eggs in her basket. She found some more
                eggs in the chicken coop. Now she has 8 eggs. How many more eggs did Joyce find in the chicken coop?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>When you suspect that wording is the cause of children&#8217;s difficulty, pose problems with <em>similar
                structure</em> but with wording in which the actions and quantities follow a chronological or natural
            story order. Children can gain confidence with the easier wording, but eventually they need to be challenged
            to make sense of the more difficult wording. Here are some strategies to help support children when they are
            challenged with more difficult wording:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Ask children to talk about what is happening in the problem. (See the suggestions in the later
                    section, &#8220;<a class="xref" href="chapter0009_17.xhtml#chap9-head3_15">Analyzing Contextual
                        Problems</a>.&#8221;)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have children use counters to act out the problem, explaining what the counters stand for and what is
                    happening in the problem.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have children draw pictures that represent each of the quantities in the problem. Then have them
                    describe the relationships between these quantities.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Choosing Numbers for Problems</h4>
        </header>
        <p>The structure of the problem will change the challenge of the task, but you can also vary the challenge by
            the numbers you choose to use. If a child struggles with a problem, use smaller numbers to see if it is the
            size of the numbers causing the difficulty. You can also intensify the challenge by increasing the size of
            the numbers. In general, the numbers in the problems should be in accord with the children&#8217;s number
            development. According to the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>), by the end of their respective school years, kindergartners
            should be able to count as many as 20 objects to answer &#8220;how many?&#8221; and solve addition and
            subtraction word problems to 10; first graders should add and subtract up to 20 and demonstrate fluency up
            to 10; and second graders should be able to add and subtract fluently up to 20 using mental strategies.
            Kindergartners are also expected to decompose numbers between 11 and 19 into tens and ones; first graders
            are learning about decomposing two-digit numbers up to 100; and second graders are learning about
            decomposing three-digit numbers up to 1000.</p>
        <p>We can see that children in grades K&#8211;2 are learning about multidigit numbers and are beginning to
            understand how our base-ten system works. Rather than wait until children develop techniques for computing
            numbers, use word problems as an opportunity for them to learn about number and computation simultaneously.
            For example, a problem involving the combination of 30 and 42 has the potential to help first and second
            graders focus on sets of 10. As they decompose 42 into 40 and 2, it is not at all unreasonable to think that
            they will add 30 and 40 and then add 2 more. The structure of a word problem can strongly inf luence the
            type of strategy a child uses to solve a multidigit problem. This is especially true for children who have
            not been taught the standard algorithms for addition and subtraction. For example, consider the following
            problem.</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_10">
            <p>A school of 28 fish was swimming together in the ocean. Another school of fish decided to join them,
                making a larger school of fish. The new larger school has 64 fish. How many fish were in the second
                school of fish that joined the first group of fish?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Because the preceding problem has a join action, this increases the probability that children will use a
            counting-on or an add-on approach to solve the problem. Using an open number line to support a more
            efficient strategy than simply counting on by ones, a child might reason as follows: Add 2 to 28 to reach
            30, add 30 more to get to 60, add 4 more to reach 64. Then add <math display="inline"

            </math> (the amounts added to 28 to reach 64). Another child might add 40 to 28 which equals 68 and then
            take off the 4 extra&#8212;4 back from 40 is 36. You can learn more about <em>invented strategies</em> for
