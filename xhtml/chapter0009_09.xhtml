        <p>Many children will use models such as counters, diagrams, or number lines to solve story problems. These
            models are thinking tools that help them understand what is happening in the problem and help them keep
            track of the numbers and steps in solving the problem. Problems can also be posed using models when there is
            no context involved.</p>

        </header>
        <p>When the parts of a set are known, addition is used to name the whole in terms of the parts. This simple
            definition of addition serves both <em>action situations</em> (join and separate) and static or
            <em>no-action situations</em> (part&#8211;part&#8211;whole).</p>
        <p>Each part&#8211;part&#8211;whole model shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-3">Figure
                9.3</a> represents <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

            </math>. Some of these are the result of a definite put together (i.e., add to) or joining action, and some
            are not. Notice that in every example, both of the parts are distinct, even after the parts are combined.
            For children to see a relationship between the two parts and the whole, the image of the 5 and 3 must be
            kept as two separate sets. In other words, the two parts should be in separate piles, on separate sections
            of a mat, or should be two different colors. This helps children reflect on the action after it has
            occurred: &#8220;These red chips are the ones I started with. Then I added these three blue chips, and now I
            have eight chips altogether.&#8221;</p>

        <p>The use of <em>bar diagrams</em> (also called <em>strip</em> or <em>tape diagrams</em>) as semiconcrete
            visual representations is a central fixture of both Japanese curriculum and what is known as <em>Singapore
                mathematics</em> and can be found in increasingly more classrooms <span id="page158" class="pagebreak"
                title="158" />in the United States. As with other tools, these diagrams support children&#8217;s
            mathematical thinking by generating &#8220;meaning-making space&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_287"
                >Murata, 2008</a>, p. 399) and are a precursor to the use of number lines.
            Murata states, &#8220;Tape diagrams are designed to bring forward the relational meanings of the quantities
            in a problem by showing the connections in context&#8221; (p. 396).</p>

        <p>A <em>number line</em> is an essential model, but it can initially present conceptual difficulties for
            children below second grade and children with disabilities (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_288"
                >National Research Council, 2009</a>). This is partially due to
            children&#8217;s difficulty in seeing the unit, which is a challenge when the number line appears as a
            continuous line. A number line is also a shift from counting a number of objects in a collection to counting
            length units. There are, however, ways to introduce and model number lines that support young learners as
            they learn to use this representation (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-4">Figure
                9.4</a>).</p>

                each interval with hops labeled, plus 5 and plus 3 above the curves. The second number line has bars of

        <p><a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-4">Figure 9.4</a> shows an instructional sequence of four
            number line models that can be used to introduce children to the more commonly used number line model and
            then to the open number line model. The first number line in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-4">Figure 9.4</a> accentuates the spaces (or the units) between the
            numerals by using thin rectangular strips in alternating colors. Children can also build a number line by
            using a given length, such as a set of Cuisenaire rods or linking cubes of the same color. The rectangular
            strips, rods, and linking cubes show that each length unit is &#8220;one unit,&#8221; and that same unit is
            repeated over and over (iterated) to form the number line (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_277"
                >Dougherty, Flores, Louis, &amp; Sophian, 2010</a>). Eventually introduce the
            tick marks in between the accentuated spaces or intervals as shown in the second number line. Over time
            remove the rectangular strips that accentuate spaces and move to the more commonly seen number line, the
            third number line in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-4">Figure 9.4</a>. The open number
            line, the fourth model shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-4">Figure 9.4</a>, has been
            found to be an effective way for children to keep track of and communicate their reasoning (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_281" >Fosnot &amp; Dolk, 2001</a>). Before using
            open number lines, children need to demonstrate the understanding that they are counting spaces as opposed
            to numbers or tick marks.</p>
        <p><span id="page159" class="pagebreak" title="159" />A number line measures distances from zero the same way a
            ruler does. If you don&#8217;t emphasize the unit (length) when teaching how to use the number line,
            children may focus on the tick marks or numerals instead of the spaces (a misunderstanding that becomes
            apparent when their answers are consistently off by one). In each version of the number line model, use
            arrows (hops) for each number in an expression to illustrate the length concept more clearly (see <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-4">Figure 9.4</a>). To model the

            Then show the three hops, counting, &#8220;six seven, eight&#8221; (not &#8220;one, two, three&#8221;) to
            demonstrate the counting-on model and reinforce the mental process.</p>

            you start with a whole set of 8 and from that remove a set of 3, the two sets that you know are the sets of
            8 and 3. The expression <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

            &#8220;take away.&#8221;) Notice that the models in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-3">Figure 9.3</a> are models for subtraction as well as addition
            (except for the action). Helping children see that they are using the same models or pictures connects the
            two operations through their inverse relationship.<span id="page160" class="pagebreak" title="160" /></p>

            <p>Use a context or story about something that is hiding to introduce this activity. For example, the book
                <em>Five Little Monkeys Play Hide-and-Seek</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_271"
                    >Christelow, 2004</a>) and the &#8220;lift the flap&#8221; book
                <em>What&#8217;s Hiding in There?</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_279"
                    >Drescher, 2008</a>) offer scenarios where various animals are hiding.
                Explain to the children that they will model the animals using a fixed number of tiles placed on a mat.
                One child separates the tiles into two parts while another covers his or her eyes. The first child
                covers one of the two parts with a sheet of paper or a large index card, revealing only the other part
                (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-5">Figure 9.5(b)</a>). The second child says the subtraction sentence. For example, &#8220;Nine minus four
                [the visible part] is five [the hidden part].&#8221; The hidden part can be revealed for the child to
                self-check. Have children record both the subtraction equation and the addition equation. ELLs may need
                sentence prompts such as &#8220;______minus ______ equals ______.&#8221;</p>

            <h4 class="title">Subtraction as Think-Addition</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Note that in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#ch09-Activity-9-3">Activities 9.3</a> and <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#ch09-Activity-9-5">9.5</a>, the situations end with two distinct
            parts, even when there is a remove action. The removed part remains on the mat as a model for an addition
            equation to be written after writing the subtraction equation. A discussion of how these two equations can
            be written for the same situation is an important opportunity to connect the operations of addition and
            subtraction. This is more cognitively engaging than the traditional worksheet activity of &#8220;fact
            families&#8221; in which children are given a family of numbers, such as 3, 5, and 8, and are asked to write
            two addition equations and two subtraction equations. This often becomes a meaningless process of dropping
            the numbers into slots without much thought.</p>
        <p>Thinking about subtraction as &#8220;think-addition&#8221; rather than &#8220;take-away&#8221; is significant
            for mastering subtraction facts. Because the tiles for the remaining or unknown part are left hidden under
            the cover in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#ch09-Activity-9-5">Activity 9.5</a>, when children
            do such activities they are encouraged to think: &#8220;What goes with the part I see to make the
            whole?&#8221; For example, if the total or whole number of tiles is nine, and six tiles can be seen, the
            child is likely to think in terms of &#8220;6 and what amount add to 9?&#8221; or &#8220;What goes with 6 to
            equal 9?&#8221; The mental activity is &#8220;think-addition&#8221; instead of &#8220;count what&#8217;s
            left.&#8221; Later, when working on subtraction facts, a subtraction fact such as <math display="inline"
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render81.png"
                alttext="9 minus 6 equals square" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="250" class="informalequation">

            <h4 class="title">Comparison Models</h4>
        </header>
        <p><em>Comparison situations</em> involve two distinct sets or quantities and the difference between them.
            Several ways of modeling the difference relationship are shown in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_09.xhtml#fig_9-6">Figure 9.6</a>. The same model can be used whether the difference or
            one of the two quantities is unknown.</p>

            <p>A diagram of 3 models for the difference between 8 and 5. The first model has a group of 8 counters and a
                group of 5 counters. 5 counters from the group of 8 have dotted lines extending to the counters in the
                second set with the remaining 3 counters in a dotted circle. The second model has a set of 8 counting
                cubes and a set of 5 counting cubes with 3 cubes on the set of 8 labeled difference. The third model has
                a n umber line with a single hop from 0 to 8 labeled 8, and a hop from 0 to 5, labeled plus 5 and a hop
                from 5 to 8 labeled question mark.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Note that typically it is not immediately clear to children how to associate either the addition or
            subtraction operations with a comparison situation. From an adult vantage point, you can see that if you
            match part of the larger amount with the smaller amount, the large set can be thought of as the whole in a
            part&#8211;part&#8211;whole model that can help you solve the problem. <span id="page161" class="pagebreak"
                title="161" />In fact, children may model compare problems in just this manner. But it is a challenge
            for children to track on this idea if they do not construct the idea themselves.</p>
        <p>The more obvious strategy is to have pairs of children show two amounts, perhaps with two bars of connecting
            cubes, of say, how many pencils are in each of their backpacks. Discuss the difference between the two bars
            to generate the third number. For example, if the children make a bar of 10 and a bar of 6, ask, &#8220;How
            many more do we need to match the bar of 10?&#8221; The unmatched cubes in the longer bar represent the
            difference of 4. Ask, &#8220;What equations can we make with these three numbers?&#8221; You can also have
            children make up story problems that involve the two amounts of 10 and 6. Discuss which equations go with
            the problems that are created.</p>
