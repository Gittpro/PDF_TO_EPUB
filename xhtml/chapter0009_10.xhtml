        <p>Although the properties we discuss in this section are algebraic in nature (because they are generalized
            rules), they are discussed here because the meanings of the properties are essential to understanding how
            numbers can be added and subtracted. Explicit attention to these concepts, with the goal of building the
            terminology over time, will help children become more flexible and efficient in how they combine numbers.

            <h4 class="title">The Commutative Property for Addition</h4>
        </header>
        <p>The <em>commutative property</em> (sometimes known as the <em>order property</em>) for addition means that
            you can change the order of the addends and it does not change the answer. Although the commutative property
            may seem obvious to us (simply reverse the two piles of counters on the part&#8211;part&#8211;whole mat), it
            may not be obvious to children. Because this property is essential in problem solving (e.g., counting on
            from the larger number), mastering basic facts (if you know <math display="inline"

                </mrow>
            </math>), and mental mathematics, there is value in spending time helping children construct the
            relationship (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_267" >Baroody, Wilkins, &amp;
                Tiilikainen, 2003</a>). First graders do not need to be able to name the property as much as they need
            to understand and visualize it, know why it applies to addition and not subtraction, and apply it (CCSS
            1.OA.B.3). But, as a caution, you should always name the property accurately and avoid using a
            &#8220;nickname&#8221; that will confuse the child (and subsequent teachers), such as calling it the
            &#8220;ring around the Rosie&#8221; property. Such arbitrary names are confusing as children progress. Use
            the precise terminology.</p>

            <p><strong>6 Attend to precision.</strong></p>
        </aside>
        <p><a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_295" >Schifter (2001)</a> describes children who
            discovered the commutative property while examining sums to ten. When the children were asked whether they
            thought it would always work many were unsure if it worked all of the time and were especially unsure about
            it working with large numbers. The point is that children may see and accept the commutative property for
            sums they&#8217;ve experienced but not be able to explain or even believe that this important property works
            for all addition combinations. Asking children to think about when properties do (and don&#8217;t) apply is
            at the heart of mathematics, addressing numeration, reasoning, generalizing, and algebraic thinking.</p>
        <p>To help children focus on the commutative property, pair problems that have the same addends but in different
            orders. Using different contexts for each problem can help children focus on the similarity in the problems
            (i.e., the same addends). For example:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_11">
            <p>Tania is on <a class="xref" href="chapter0001_04.xhtml#page8">See here</a> in her book. Tomorrow she
                hopes to read 6 more pages. What page will she be on if she reads that many pages?</p>
        </aside>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_12">
            <p>The recycling bin in the cafeteria had 6 bottles in it. During lunch 8 more bottles were put in the bin.
                How many bottles were in the bin after lunch?</p>
        </aside>
        <p><span id="page162" class="pagebreak" title="162" />Ask if anyone can describe how these problems are alike.
            When done as a pair of problems, some children (not all) will see that having solved one they have
            essentially solved the other. Pose multiple problem pairs across time to help children learn from experience
            that the two addends can be added in either order without changing the answer. Note that some children will
            overgeneralize the commutative property to subtraction. Use contextual situations and story problems to help
            them confront this misconception.</p>

            <h4 class="title">The Associative Property for Addition</h4>
        </header>
        <p>The <em>associative property</em> for addition states that when adding three or more numbers, it does not
            matter whether the first pair is added first or if you start with any other pair of addends. This knowledge
            is expected of first graders in the CCSS in Standard 1.OA.B.2 (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>). This property allows a lot of flexibility so children can
            change how they group numbers to work with combinations they know. For example, knowing this property can
            help children identify &#8220;combinations of ten&#8221; from the numbers they are adding by mentally
            grouping numbers differently than just reading the expression from left to right.</p>

                </math>. Children should show how they added the numbers. For children with disabilities, you may need
                to initially support their decision making, suggesting that they look for a 10 or a double and have them
                underline or circle those numbers as a starting point.</p>
        </aside>
        <p><a class="xref" href="chapter0009_10.xhtml#fig_9-7">Figure 9.7</a> illustrates how children might show what
            they did. As they share their solutions, there will be some who added numbers together using different pairs
            and in a different order but got the same result. They used both the associative and the commutative
            properties here, but it is more important to highlight the commutative property because of its usefulness to
            mental strategies, mastering basic facts, and problem solving. This is also an excellent number sense
            activity because many children will find combinations of 10 in these sums or will use doubles. Learning to
            adjust strategies to fit the numbers is the beginning of the road to computational fluency.</p>
