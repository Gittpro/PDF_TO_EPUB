                Multiplication and Division</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> recommends that second graders work with equal groups of objects to
            build a foundation for the formal study of multiplication (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>). Multiplication and division are often taught separately,
            with multiplication preceding division. It is important, however, to combine multiplication and division
            soon after multiplication has been introduced to help children see how these operations have an inverse
            relationship. In most curricula, these topics are first presented in grade 2 and then become a major focus
            of the third grade and beyond. When approached with a problem-solving perspective, kindergarten through
            second-grade children can be quite successful at solving contextual and story problems involving
            multiplication and division, even division with remainders, prior to being taught formal computational
            methods and the symbols used for multiplication and division (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_269"
                >Carpenter, Fennema, Franke, Levi, &amp; Empson, 2014</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_294" >Schifter, Bastable, &amp; Russell, 1999</a>;
            <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_292" >Roberts, 2003</a>). Young children engage in
            situations such as counting equal groups (multiplication) and fairly sharing or measuring out (division) in
            their daily lives. Capitalizing on these kinds of informal experiences can help lay a good foundation for
            more formal study of these operations in later grades. Multiplication and division problems also provide
            children with opportunities to work with the idea of groups, which helps with the development of place value
            and grouping in tens.</p>

            <h3 class="title" id="chap9-head3_10">Multiplication and Division Problem Structures</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Although there are structures for multiplication other than <em>equal groups</em> (also known as repeated
            addition) and <em>arrays</em> (CCSS includes arrays with area), we will focus on these particular structures
            because they relate well to the addition work in which children in grades preK&#8211;2 have been involved
            and are typically how multiplication and division are explored in the earlier grades.</p>
        <p>Examples of the problem types for multiplication and division are shown in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_12.xhtml#tab_9-2">Table 9.2</a>. Problems matching these structures can be modeled
            with sets of counters, number lines, or arrays. (The term multiplicative is used here to describe all
            problems that involve multiplication and division.) You can find more examples of these problem types in the
            <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (see Table 2 in the CCSSI Math Standards Glossary; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270" >CCSSO, 2010</a>, p. 89).</p>

            <h4 class="title">Equal-Group Problems</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Equal-group problems involve three quantities: the number of groups, the size of each group, and the total.
            These quantities are illustrated in the following problem:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_14">
            <p>Jill has 4 bags of crayons. There are 3 crayons in each bag. All together she has 12 crayons.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>In a given problem, any of these three quantities can be unknown (see <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0009_12.xhtml#tab_9-2">Table 9.2(a)</a>). When the number and size of groups are known
            (total is unknown), the problem is a <em>multiplication</em> situation. When either the group size is
            unknown (How many in each group?) or the number of groups is unknown (How many groups?), the problem is a
            <em>division</em> situation. But note that these division situations are not alike. When the size of the
            groups is unknown but the number of groups is known, the problems are called <em>fair-sharing</em> or
            <em>partition</em> problems. The whole is shared or distributed among the known number of groups to
            determine the group size. When the number of groups is unknown but the size of the equal groups is known,
            the problems are called <em>measurement division</em> or sometimes <span id="page165" class="pagebreak"
                title="165" /><em>repeated subtraction</em> problems. The whole is &#8220;measured off&#8221; or
            repeatedly subtracted in groups of the given size. Watch this <a
                    href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/0106_iPad" class="ulink">video clip</a>
            where you will see a child demonstrating measurement division as he uses the known total and group size to
            find the number of groups (unknown).</p>
        <p>For K&#8211;2 children, equal-group problems can be related to <em>repeated addition</em> problems: 4 equal
            groups of 3 or <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

                    <mn>3</mn>
                </mrow>
            </math>. This is an important initial connection for young learners to make, as multiplication and repeated
            addition produce the same results for positive whole numbers.</p>
        <p>There is also a subtle difference between problems that might be termed equal-group problems (e.g., If 3
            children have 4 apples each, how many apples are there?) and those that might be termed <em>rate</em>
            problems (e.g., If there are 4 apples per child, how many apples would 3 children have?). Note that rate
            problems can be more difficult for younger children because they involve working with a composed unit (a
            rate, such as number of apples per child) rather than a number of countable objects. When the rate is
            something children can concretely model (number of apples per child as opposed to miles per hour), rate
            problems can be thought of in much the same way as the equal-group problems. You should consider posing such
            problems.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Array Problems</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Arrays are initially considered in second grade in the CCSS as addition situations with equal groups. The
            array is a model for an equal-group situation (<a class="xref" href="chapter0009_12.xhtml#tab_9-2">Table
                9.2(b)</a>). It is shown as a rectangular grouping, with one factor representing the number of rows and
            the other representing <span id="page166" class="pagebreak" title="166" />the number found in each row. CCSS
            groups arrays with area rather than with the equal-group problems because arrays can be thought of as a
            logical lead-in to the row-and-column structure of an area problem. Note that area problems are not
            introduced until third grade in the CCSS.</p>
