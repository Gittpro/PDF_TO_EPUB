<h2 class="title">Teaching Multiplication and Division</h2>
</header>
<p>A major conceptual hurdle in working with multiplicative structures is understanding that while a group contains multiple items these groups can also be seen as single entities (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_268" >Blote, Lieffering, &amp; Ouewhand, 2006</a>). Children can solve the problem, &#8220;How many apples are in 4 baskets with 8 apples each?&#8221; without thinking multiplicatively simply by counting out four sets of eight counters and then counting all. To think multiplicatively about this problem requires children to conceptualize each group of eight as a single item to be counted four times. Experiences with making and counting equal groups, especially in contextual situations, are extremely useful in preparing children to develop multiplicative thinking.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="chap9-head3_11">Contextual Problems</h3>
</header>
<p>As with addition and subtraction, there is more to think about than simply giving children word problems to solve. Use contexts based on children&#8217;s experiences and ones that all children can access. For children who are beginning to talk about fractions, include partition problems in which items can be subdivided into fractional parts (brownies, pies, cups of milk, etc.). When a familiar context is used, children are more likely to demonstrate a spontaneous and meaningful approach to solve the problem because they are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>The tendency in the United States is to have children solve many problems in a single class period with a focus on getting the answers. But if you change the focus to sense making, solving only a few problems, strategically using tools such as physical materials, drawings, as well as equations, can be a better approach. Whatever children write on paper, they should explain it in enough detail for someone else to follow their thinking. Leave enough space on an activity sheet to encourage multiple strategies and explanations&#8212;leaving only a small space will prompt just an answer and nothing more.</p>
<p>Snack time is a familiar context that provides lots of opportunities for children to explore the notion of fair sharing or partition division as the next activity illustrates.</p>

<p>Read <em>Snack Attack</em> (Ruschak &amp; Carter, 1990) as a lead-in to this activity. In pairs or small groups, children work with a bag of snacks, such as crackers or cookies, to determine how many each child in the group will get. Because the children will be handling the snacks, you can either use pictures of the snacks that have been cut out or have additional snacks on hand for children to eat after the activity. To differentiate, prepare baggies of different amounts of the snack and place children in different-sized groups. For example, give a bag of 12 cookies to a group of 3 children; a bag of 10 cookies to 3 children; a bag of 16 cookies to 4 children; or a bag of 15 cookies to 4 children. The scenarios depend on whether your children are ready for the challenge of dealing with leftovers. As children are engaged in this sharing activity, circulate and ask children to explain their reasoning. In particular, look for ways that children deal with leftovers as well as whether children distribute the snacks in amounts other than by ones. Capture their ideas on a note pad or an iPad to help them share their ideas in a discussion later.</p>

<p><span id="page167" class="pagebreak" title="167"/><a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_292" >Roberts (2003)</a> described a teacher who used the children&#8217;s book <em>Snack Attack</em> and a similar sharing activity with her kindergartners. The article describes the various strategies children used to fairly share their snack and how the teacher supported the children as they shared their strategies during discussion time. You can refer to the article for more ideas. <em>One Hundred Hungry Ants</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_290" >Pinczes, 1999</a>) and <em>Remainder of One</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_291" >Pinczes, 2002</a>) are two additional children&#8217;s books that provide engaging contexts for children to explore multiplication and division.</p>

<h4 class="title">Symbolism for Multiplication and Division</h4>
</header>
<p>When children solve simple multiplication story problems before learning about multiplication symbolism, they will most likely begin by writing addition equations to represent what they did. In fact, the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> recommends that second graders begin to write equations to express the total as a sum of equal addends (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). If you feel your children are ready, introduce the multiplication sign and explain what the two factors mean. You can also write one sentence that expresses both concepts at once, for example, <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render97.png" alttext="9 plus 9 plus 9 plus 9 equals 4 cross times 9" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="550" class="informalequation"><mrow><mn>9</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>&#215;</mo><mn>9</mn></mrow></math>.</p>
<p>In the United States, the usual convention is that <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render98.png" alttext="4 cross times 8" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="350" class="informalequation"><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#215;</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow></math> refers to four sets of eight, not eight sets of four. (In other countries such as Japan and Korea, the convention is that <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render98.png" alttext="4 cross times 8" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="350" class="informalequation"><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>&#215;</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow></math> refers to four taken eight times or eight sets of four.) In vertical form, usually the bottom factor indicates the number of sets or groups. These conventions allow us to communicate with each other more clearly about the problem and help build toward the commutative property of multiplication. However, with younger children, the more important idea is the informal explorations with multiplication and division situations and not the introduction of symbolism.</p>

<p><strong>6 Attend to precision.</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>Related to communication about these operations is the use of the unfortunate phrase &#8220;goes into,&#8221; as in &#8220;6 goes into 24,&#8221; when referring to division. This phrase carries little meaning about division, especially in connection with a fair-sharing or partitioning context. The &#8220;goes into&#8221; terminology is simply ingrained in adults&#8217; speech; it has not been in textbooks for years. Instead of this phrase, use appropriate terminology with children, such as &#8220;How many groups of 6 are in 24?&#8221;</p>
<header>
<h4 class="title">Choosing Numbers for Problems</h4>
</header>
<p>An understanding of the idea of products or quotients is not affected by the size of the numbers involved as long as the numbers are within your children&#8217;s grasp. Although a CCSS expectation for second graders is to work with arrays with up to 5 rows and up to 5 columns, a contextual problem involving 6 equal groups of 8 stickers or 24 grapes fairly shared with 3 people is not out of reach for second graders. When given the challenge of making sense of these contextual situations, children will invent computational strategies (e.g., two 8s or 16 three times) or they will model the problem with manipulatives (e.g., sharing 24 tiles among three friends).</p>
<p>More often than not, in real world situations, division does not result in a whole number. So even in the early grades, pose division story problems with remainders. Discuss the different ways that children think about dealing with remainders in a given context. Remainders can be handled in these ways:</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li><p>The remainder is identified as simply left over.</p></li>
<li><p>The remainder is partitioned into fractional parts.</p></li>
<li><p>The remainder is discarded, leaving a smaller whole-number answer.</p></li>
<li><p>The remainder can &#8220;force&#8221; the answer to the next highest whole number.</p></li>
<li><p>The answer is rounded to the nearest whole number for an approximate result.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="page168" class="pagebreak" title="168"/>The following story problems illustrate all five possibilities for handling remainders. As can be seen in these examples, <em>partition division</em> story problems lend themselves more readily to fraction remainders (as opposed to <em>measurement division</em> story problems).</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li><p><em>Left over.</em> You have 10 pieces of candy to share fairly with 3 children. How many pieces of candy will each child receive? <em>Answer:</em> 3 pieces of candy and 1 left over.
</p></li>
<li><p><em>Partitioned as a fraction.</em> You have 9 brownies and you want to fairly share with 4 children. How many brownies will each child receive? <em>Answer:</em> 2 and one-fourth brownies.
</p></li>
<li><p><em>Discarded.</em> A rope is 15 feet long. How many 7-foot jump ropes can be made? <em>Answer:</em> 2 jump ropes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Forced to next whole number.</em> If 4 children can ride in each car, how many cars are needed to take to 23 children to the museum? <em>Answer:</em> 6 cars.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rounded, approximate result.</em> If 6 children are planning to share a bag of 50 pieces of bubble gum, about how many pieces will each child get? <em>Answer:</em> About 8 pieces for each child.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In making sense of their answers, children need to pay attention to the context. For example, in problem 4 above, answering <em>5 and three-fourths</em> cars does not make any sense. Addressing what to do with remainders, given the context, should be central to teaching about division.</p>
