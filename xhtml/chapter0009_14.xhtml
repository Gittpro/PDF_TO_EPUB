        <p>In the beginning, children will be able to use the same models&#8212;sets, bar diagrams, and number
            lines&#8212;for all four operations. A model not often used for addition but extremely important and widely
            used for multiplication and division is the array. An <em>array</em> is any arrangement of objects in rows
            and columns, such as a rectangle of square tiles or blocks (see Blackline Master 16 called the <a

        <p><span id="page169" class="pagebreak" title="169" />The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> recommend that
            second graders work with the array model with no more than five rows and five columns to lay the foundation
            for multiplication (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270" >CCSSO, 2010</a>).
            However, even younger children can use the array model to begin to help them organize quantities and
            skip-count. Because you want to move children beyond counting by ones and encourage children&#8217;s use of
            rows and columns as units, use small quantities arranged in arrays to play off their ability to
            <em>subitize</em> (quickly recognize the amount without counting).</p>

            <p>Find places where you live that organize items into arrays, such as a bakery or a grocery store. Take
                pictures of these items&#8212;for example, a tray of doughnuts or muffins, a box of oranges or apples.
                You can also find pictures online for this purpose. (Check out the website for the Harry &amp; David
                stores as one possibility.) Show these pictures to your children and set up the task by telling them
                that the baker, grocer, or person making an online order needs their help to determine how many items
                are on the tray or in the box. Allow children to use a strategy that makes sense to them, which
                initially may be counting by ones. Look for children who use skip counting and have them share their
                strategy so that this idea is introduced to other children (make sure to emphasize the structure of the
                rows/columns). You can repeat this activity several times with different contexts and different
                pictures.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Even when using arrays that are arranged in quantities more likely to be subitized, some children may not be
            ready to move beyond counting by ones. Allow them to count by ones but continue to provide them
            opportunities to work with these kinds of arrays and to hear how other children are paying attention to the
            structure of the rows/columns and using small amounts to efficiently skip-count. Given time, these children
            will also begin to track on the structure of arrays and use equal groups to count more efficiently.</p>

            <p>The idea of organizing quantities into rows and columns might seem a bit arbitrary to children. So it is
                important to use contexts in which this arrangement seems natural (e.g., a muffin pan, doughnuts on a
                tray, fruit displayed at a grocery store, a checkers board, a parade formation).</p>

            <p>Using the context of a story about sharing, such as <em>Bean Thirteen</em> (<a
                    class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_286" >McElligott, 2007</a>), provide children
                with a supply of counters (beans) and a way to place them into small groups (small paper cups). Have
                children count out a number of counters to be the whole or total amount (e.g., start with 16) and record
                this number. Next specify either the number of equal groups to be made or the size of the groups:
                &#8220;Separate your counters into four equal-sized groups,&#8221; or &#8220;Make as many groups of four
                as possible.&#8221; Next, if ready for symbolism, have the children write the corresponding repeated
                addition and/or multiplication equation for what their materials show. For ELLs, be sure they know what
                <em>groups</em>, <em>equal-sized groups,</em> and <em>groups of four</em> mean. For children with
                disabilities, consider having them start with a partition approach (i.e., separate your counters into 2
                groups), in which they share the counters by placing them one at a time into each cup. Explore the

                        class="ulink">Expanded Lesson: Divide and Conquer</a> for additional details about this
                activity.</p>

        <p>In <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_14.xhtml#ch09-Activity-9-9">Activity 9.9</a>, &#8220;Divide and
            Conquer,&#8221; be sure to include both types of situations: number of equal groups unknown and size of
            groups unknown. Discuss with the class how these two situations are different, how each is related to
            multiplication, and how each can be written as repeated addition and multiplication equations. Do <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0009_14.xhtml#ch09-Activity-9-9">Activity 9.9</a> several times. Start with
            whole quantities that are multiples of the divisor (no remainders) but soon include situations with
            remainders. Note that it is technically incorrect to write the answer to a division problem, like 18 cookies
            shared equally with 4 people, as 4 R 2 because this is not a number (the answer should be a number). As
            written, the 2 is not well defined because it is really two-fourths. If your children have experience
            working with the resulting fractional parts, have them write or say the fractional part (e.g., two-fourths).
            Otherwise, in the beginning, the form 4 R 2 may be appropriate until children have experience with the given
            fractional parts.</p>
        <p>&#8220;Divide and Conquer&#8221; can be varied by changing the model. Have children build arrays using square
            tiles or have them draw arrays on square grid paper. Present the exercises by specifying how many squares
            are to be in the array. Then specify the number of rows that should be made (partition) or the length of
            each row (measurement). How could children model remainders using drawings of arrays on grid paper? Explore
            the applet &#8220;Rectangle Division&#8221; on the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives website for an
            interactive illustration of division with remainders.</p>

            <p>A good way to check on children&#8217;s understanding of the operations is to pose several story problems
                with different operations. Have them work on two or three problems a day over the course of a week. If
                your objective is to find out about their understanding of the operations, rather than having them
                actually do the computations, have them indicate what operation(s) they would use and with what numbers.
                To avoid guessing, you can have children draw a picture to explain why they chose the operation that
                they did. Alternatively, you can have the children come up with story problems to go with given models
                or equations.</p>
