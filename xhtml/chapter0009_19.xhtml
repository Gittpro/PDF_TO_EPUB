</header>
<p>In the early years, solving story problems provides an excellent place to develop children&#8217;s habit of providing explanations. For children in grades preK&#8211;2, explanations can range from verbal statements to drawings to written words. You may find that children who know their basic facts or have learned traditional methods of computing will write little more than the computations they used. It is important to make clear that you want explanations that use words, numbers, and drawings so that someone else can follow their reasoning and understand their solution.</p>

<p><strong>3 Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>The solutions shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_19.xhtml#fig_9-11">Figure 9.11</a> are from children aged 4 to 7. Laura, a beginning second grader, used separate equations to represent the amounts. Emma, who was just beginning first grade, chose to use a weekly calendar format to help her think about the problem and keep track of the amounts. Abby, a prekindergarten child, after hearing the story problem read twice, drew her circles using spacing to help organize her ideas. When asked how many eggs were found, she counted and got 15. She wrote the numeral 15 with help.</p>

<p>The problem is as follows: I went to visit Missus Sato's farm last week. On Monday, I found 1 egg. On Tuesday, I found 2 eggs. On Wednesday, I found 3 eggs. On Thursday, I found 4 eggs. On Friday, I found 5 eggs. How many eggs did I find last week? Student 1, Laura, writes, 1 plus 2 = 3, 3 plus 3 = 6, 6 plus 4 = 10, 10 plus 5 = 15. Answer 15. Student 2, Emma, writes a table with 7 boxes labeled left to right, s, m, t, w, t h, f, sat, and contain 1 circle in box m, 2 circles in box t, 3 circles in box w, 4 circles in box t h, 5 circles in box f and none written in box sat. Circles are numbers left to right 1 to 15 with the 15 written below. The third student, Abby, has sets of circles as follows, a single circle, 2 circles, 3 circles, 4 circles, 5 circles, with the number 15 below.</p>
</details>
<p>As children continue be asked to show their reasoning, they will improve both from practice and from seeing the methods used by others. In the examples in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_19.xhtml#fig_9-11">Figure 9.11</a>, the children are showing how they solved the problem. To extend their explanations, you might ask questions such as, &#8220;Why do you think your answer is correct?&#8221; or &#8220;Why did you decide that addition (or whatever operation was used) was the right thing to do in this problem?&#8221;</p>

<p>Many children have difficulty with problems in which the start is unknown because they try to model the problem in chronological order and they cannot make the set that represents the beginning of the problem. Suggest that children use an index card with a question mark written on it to represent the unknown start amount.</p>
<p>Sometimes children can become so involved in drawing detailed realistic pictures of objects mentioned in problems that they lose sight of the mathematics (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_275" >Crespo &amp; Kyriakides, 2007</a>). Engage in a discussion about what makes a good drawing in mathematics versus a good drawing for other purposes. In mathematics, drawings should be simple and only include information relevant to solving the problem.</p>
