        <p>Two-step word problems appear for the first time in the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_270" >CCSSO, 2010</a>) when second-graders are
            expected to solve two-step addition and subtraction word problems (2.OA.A.1). You can watch <a

            multistep story problem using the computation <math display="inline"

                    <mn>6</mn>
                    <mo>&#215;</mo>
                    <mn>2</mn>
                    <mo>&#x02212;</mo>
                    <mn>5</mn>
                </mrow>
            </math>. First, be sure children can analyze the structure of one-step problems in the way that we have
            discussed. The following ideas, adapted from <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_284"
                >Huinker (1994)</a>, are designed to help children see how two problems can be
            linked together to help think about multistep problems.</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p>Give children a one-step problem and have them solve it. Before discussing the answer, have the
                    children use the answer to the first problem to create a second problem. The <span id="page176"
                        class="pagebreak" title="176" />rest of the class can then be asked to solve one of these
                    created problems, as in the following example:</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_21">
            <p><em>Given problem:</em> Ryan has 14 crayons and Nathan gives Ryan 11 crayons. Now how many crayons does
                Ryan have?</p>
            <p><em>Second Problem:</em> Some of Ryan&#8217;s crayons are broken. If 20 of his crayons are not broken,
                how many crayons are broken?</p>
        </aside>
        <ol class="numbered" start="2">
            <li>
                <p>Make a &#8220;hidden question.&#8221; Repeat the approach above by giving groups different one-step
                    problems. Have them solve the first problem and write a second problem. Then <span id="page177"
                        class="pagebreak" title="177" />they should write a single combined problem that leaves out the
                    question from the first problem. The question in the given problem is the &#8220;hidden
                    question,&#8221; as in this example:</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_22">
            <p><em>Given problem:</em> Toby brought 24 cupcakes to school. Bree brought 18 cookies. How many sweets did
                they bring to school?</p>
            <p><em>Second Problem:</em> How many more sweets do they need to reach 50 sweets?</p>
            <p><em>Hidden Question Problem:</em> Toby brought 24 cupcakes to school. Bree brought 18 cookies. How many
                more sweets do they need to reach 50 sweets?</p>
        </aside>
        <!-- <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_23">
            
        </aside> -->
		<p>Have other groups identify the hidden question. Because all children are working on a similar task (be
                sure to mix the operations), they will be more likely to understand what is meant by a <em>hidden
                    question</em>.</p>
            <ol class="numbered" start="3">
                <li>
                    <p>Pose standard two-step problems, and have the children identify and answer the hidden question.
                        Consider this problem:</p>
                    
                </li>
            </ol><p>Rebekah hits a tennis ball against a wall 28 feet away. It hits the wall and bounces back 13 feet
                        and then rolls another 6 feet towards her. How far from Rebekah does the ball stop?</p>
        <p>Begin by considering the questions that were suggested earlier: &#8220;What&#8217;s happening in this
            problem?&#8221; &#8220;What will the answer tell us?&#8221; These questions will get you started. If
            children are stuck, you can ask, &#8220;Is there a hidden question in this problem?&#8221; Although the
            examples given here provide a range of contexts, using the same (and familiar) context across this
            three-step process would reduce the linguistic demands for ELLs and therefore make the stories more
            comprehensible&#8212;and the mathematics more accessible.</p>

                <h2 class="title" id="ch09_formative_04">Formative Assessment Note</h2>

            <p>One of the best ways to assess knowledge of the meaning of the operations is to have children generate
                story problems for a given equation or result (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_278"
                    >Drake &amp; Barlow, 2007</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_301"
                    >Whitin &amp; Whitin, 2008</a>). Use a diagnostic interview to see whether
                your children can flexibly think about an operation. Fold a sheet of paper into quarters or use the
                <a
                        href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Translation_Task_Template_Grades_Pre-K&#8211;2.pdf"
                        class="ulink">Translation Task</a> based on the work of <a
                    class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_299" >Shield and Swinson (1996)</a>. Give
                children an expression such as 15 &#x02212; 7; ask that they record and answer it in the upper-left-hand
                quarter, write a story problem representing the expression in the upper right quarter, draw a picture
                (or model) in the lower left section, and describe how they would tell a younger child how to solve this
                problem in the last section. (For a child with disabilities, the child could dictate the story problem
                and the description of the solving process while the teacher transcribes.) Children who can ably match
                scenarios, models, and explanations to the computation will demonstrate their understanding, whereas
                children who struggle will reveal areas of weakness. Adapt the assessment by giving children the result
                (e.g., &#8220;24 cents&#8221;) and asking them to write an addition problem (or any other appropriate
                type of problem) that will generate the given answer, along with models and word problems written in the
                remaining quarters. Another option is to use the context from a piece of children&#8217;s literature to
                create a word problem that emphasizes the meaning of one of the four operations; each child then has to
                complete the other three sections.</p>
