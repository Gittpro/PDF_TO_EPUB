                <li class="objective"><span class="number"><strong>1.</strong></span> Children move through three phases
                    in developing fluency with basic facts: counting, reasoning strategies, and mastery (<a
                        class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_307" >Baroody, 2006</a>). Instruction and
                    assessment must help children move through these phases without rushing them.</li>
                <li class="objective"><span class="number"><strong>2.</strong></span>Number relationships provide the
                    foundation for strategies that help children to remember basic facts or figure out unknown facts
                    from those already known. For example, knowing how numbers are related to 5 and 10 helps children
                    master facts such as <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/render26.png" alttext="3 plus 5" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="450" class="informalequation"><mn>3</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>5</mn></math> (think of a ten-frame) and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math180.png" alttext="8 plus 6" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="450" class="informalequation"><mn>8</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn></math> (since 8 is 2 away from 10, take 2 from
                    6 to make <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math180_1.png" alttext="10 plus 4 equals 14" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="450" class="informalequation"><mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>14</mn></math>).</li>
                <li class="objective"><span class="number"><strong>3.</strong></span> When children are not fluent with
                    the basic facts, they often need to drop back to earlier phases and revisit foundational ideas, such
                    as number relationships. More drill is not the answer.</li>
                <li class="objective"><span class="number"><strong>4.</strong></span> Helping children build a
                    foundation for multiplication involves connecting their experiences with addition doubles and skip
                    counting to the foundational multiplication facts of 2s and 5s.</li>

        <p><em>Basic facts</em> for addition are the number combinations in which both addends are less than 10.
            Subtraction facts correspond to the addition facts. Thus, <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math180_2.png" alttext="15 minus 8 equals 7" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="450" class="informalequation"><mn>15</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn></math> is a subtraction fact because
            both the corresponding addition parts are less than 10. The goal with basic facts is to develop fluency,
            which the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_317"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>) describe as being able to flexibly, accurately, efficiently,
            and appropriately solve problems. Plan your instruction and assessment for learning basic facts around these
            ideas.</p>
        <p><span id="page181" class="pagebreak" title="181" />According to the CCSS-M, second graders should be able to
            use mental strategies to fluently add and subtract within twenty, with the goal that by the end of second
            grade, they know their basic facts up to 20 from memory. It is critical that children know their basic facts
            well, but developing fluency does not start in second grade. If you teach in grades preK&#8211;1, this
            chapter is also for you because you have a very important role in helping children become fluent with their
            basic facts&#8212;aspects of number sense that are critical to developing fluency begin in prekindergarten
            and continue throughout the primary grades. The <em>Curriculum Focal Points,</em> (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_335" >NCTM, 2006</a>) recommend that children in
            preK should be able to compare quantities and use language such as &#8220;more than&#8221; and &#8220;less
            than.&#8221; The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_317"
                >CCSSO, 2010</a>) indicate that by the end of kindergarten children should be
            able to fluently add and subtract within five. First graders should be able to add and subtract within 20
            using a variety of methods, but should be fluent within 10. When we consider these standards, clearly
            fluency with basic facts occurs over a long period of time.</p>
