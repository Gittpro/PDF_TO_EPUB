<p>Guided invention also emphasizes strategies but children generate the strategies based on their knowledge of number relationships (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_321" >Gravemeijer &amp; van Galen, 2003</a>). For example, some children may think of 6 + 7 as &#8220;double 6 is 12 and one more is 13.&#8221; Others in the same class may recognize that 7 is 3 away from 10, so they take 3 from 6 to add to 7 to equal 10, and then add the remaining 3 which equals 13. Still other children may take 5 from each addend to make 10 and then add the remaining 1 and 2 to equal 13. The crucial point is that children are using number combinations and relationships that make sense to them.</p>

<p><a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_321" >Gravemeijer and van Galen (2003)</a> called this approach <em>guided invention</em> because not all children will independently develop many of the strategies that are efficient without some guidance. That is, you need to purposefully design tasks and problems that help children notice number relationships. For example, to elicit the Make 10 strategy using the 6 + 7 task, you might have children place counters in two ten-frames and then have them think of different ways to mentally move the counters to find the total.</p>
