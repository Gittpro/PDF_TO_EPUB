<h2 class="title">Reasoning Strategies for Addition Facts</h2>
</header>
<p>Recall that basic fact mastery depends on progressing through three phases. The second phase, reasoning strategies, warrants significant attention; too often children are asked to go from counting (phase 1) to memorization (phase 3). Therefore, a significant part of this chapter is devoted to the reasoning strategies that are important to teach including how to teach them well. The reasoning strategies children can and will develop are directly related to one or more number relationships that were discussed in <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_00.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>. In that chapter, numerous activities were suggested to help children develop these relationships. Now the teaching task is to help children connect these number relationships to the basic facts. In kindergarten and first grade, significant time should be devoted to decomposing and composing numbers and exploring number combinations (e.g., combinations that equal 5 and combinations that equal 10, respectively). In grade 2, children continue to develop reasoning strategies until they know their addition facts from memory. It takes many experiences over many months for children to move from using strategies to just knowing their facts. Note that no memorization is needed&#8212;just many activities like the ones shared here! The first four strategies described are foundational to the later strategies and so should be developed first.</p>

</header>
<p>Each of the 36 facts highlighted in the accompanying chart has at least one addend of 1 or 2. These facts are a direct application of the one-more-than and two-more-than relationships described in <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_00.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>. Consequently, children need to be able to count on before they are able to successfully use this strategy (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_308" >Baroody et al., 2009</a>).</p>
<p>Story problems in which one of the addends is a 1 or a 2 are easy to create. For example:</p>

<p><em>Six children were waiting in line for ice cream. Two more children got in line. How many children are waiting in line?</em></p>

</figure>
<p><span id="page188" class="pagebreak" title="188"/>Ask different children to explain how they got 8 as the answer. Some will count on from 6. Some may still need to count 6 and 2 and then count all. Others will say they knew that 2 more than 6 is 8. To help children move from counting strategies to reasoning strategies, draw their attention to the connection between counting on and adding two using a number line, ten-frame, or arithmetic rack.</p>

<p>Read <em>How Many Feet in the Bed</em>? by Diane Johnston Hamm. On the second time through the book, when a new person gets in the bed, ask children how many <em>more</em> feet are in the bed. Have children record the equation (e.g., 4 + 2) and tell how many feet in all. As family members get out of the bed, two less can be explored.</p>
<p>Find opportunities to make the connection between counting on and adding two using a number line, ten-frame, or arithmetic rack. For ELLs, clarify the meaning of <em>foot</em> (it is used here as a body part, not as a unit of measure) and be sure they know what the phrases &#8220;two more&#8221; and &#8220;two less&#8221; mean. You can further support ELLs and children with disabilities by acting out the story with children in the classroom.</p>

<p>The different responses you hear will provide you with a lot of information about children&#8217;s number sense. As children are ready to use the two-more-than idea without counting all, they can begin to practice with activities such as the following.</p>

After each roll of the dice, children should say the complete fact: &#8220;Four and two is six.&#8221; Alternatively, in place of the first die, use a spinner with &#8220;1 more&#8221; on one half and &#8220;2 more&#8221; on the other half (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_09.xhtml#fig_10-1">Figure 10.1</a>). For children with disabilities, you may want to start with a die that just has <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math_188_1.png" alttext="plus 1" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="450" class="informalequation"><mo>+</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>1</mn></math> and &#8220;one more&#8221; and then move to a <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math16_01.png" alttext="plus 2" altimg-height="100" altimg-width="450" class="informalequation"><mo>+</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>2</mn></math> and &#8220;two more&#8221; die on another day. This will help emphasize and practice one approach.
