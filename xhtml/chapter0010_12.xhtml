</header>
<p>Perhaps the most important strategy for children to know is the combinations that equal 10. Combinations of 10 are foundational facts from which children can derive many facts. In fact, when children master two types of facts&#8212;the Doubles and the Combinations of 10&#8212;they can then use those to derive most of the other challenging basic facts (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_329" >Kling, 2011</a>).</p>
<p>Use story problems such as the following to provide children opportunities to develop the Combinations of 10 strategy.</p>

</aside>
<p>The ten-frame and the arithmetic rack are useful tools for creating visual images of the number relationships. The next activity, which incorporates the ten-frame, is a good way to introduce the Combinations of 10 strategy.</p>

<p>Place counters on a ten-frame and ask, &#8220;How many more to equal 10?&#8221; (See <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_12.xhtml#fig_10-3">Figure 10.3</a>.) This activity can be repeated using different starting numbers. Eventually, show an empty ten-frame and say a number less than 10. Children start with that number and complete the &#8220;10 fact.&#8221; If you say, &#8220;four,&#8221; they say, &#8220;four plus six is ten.&#8221; This activity can be completed as a whole class or in pairs. Children who are still in phase 1 of learning the facts (using counting strategies) or children with disabilities may need one-on-one support to help them focus their attention on how the structure of the ten-frame (e.g., groups of 5, empty places within the 5) can help them move away from counting by ones.</p>

<p>There are several children&#8217;s books whose storylines lend themselves to finding the combinations that make ten. <em>Anno&#8217;s Counting House</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_303" >Anno, 1982</a>), an older book for which used copies can be found online, tells the story of ten children who move one by one from their old house to a new house. The context suggests a systematic way to think about the changing combinations, which can help children verify that they have found all the possible combinations of ten. <em>There Were Ten in the Bed</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_331" >Kubler, 2001</a>) is another book that can be used to spur children to think about the Combinations of 10. The book is based on the nursery song with the chorus, &#8220;roll over, roll over.&#8221; Ten children start in the bed and as one child says &#8220;roll over, roll over,&#8221; they all roll over and one of the children falls out of the bed. This pattern continues until only one child is left in the bed. All the combinations of 10, except 0 + 10 and 10 + 0, can be systematically found by following the storyline.</p>
