<h2 class="title">Reasoning Strategies for Subtraction Facts</h2>
</header>
<p>Subtraction facts prove to be more difficult than addition. This is especially true when children have been taught subtraction through a &#8220;count-count-count&#8221; approach; for 13 &#8211; 5, <em>count</em> 13, <em>count</em> off 5, <em>count</em> what&#8217;s left. Remember that counting is the first phase in reaching basic fact mastery. The goal is to move children beyond counting strategies to ensure they master their basic facts.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="chapter0010_01.xhtml#Tab_10-1">Table 10.1</a> at the beginning of this chapter lists the ways children might subtract as they move from counting to reasoning to mastery. Without opportunities to learn and use reasoning strategies, children continue to rely on counting strategies for subtraction facts, which can be slow and too often result in inaccurate answers. Spending sufficient time on the following reasoning strategies can help children move to phase 2 and eventually on to mastery (phase 3). You can also help children build stronger connections between addition and subtraction by posing more join and separate story problems with start and change unknowns as well as more part-part-whole and comparison story problems (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>).</p>

<p>As the label implies, in this strategy children use known addition facts to produce the unknown quantity or part (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_16.xhtml#fig_10-6">Figure 10.6</a>). If this important relationship between parts and wholes&#8212;between addition and subtraction&#8212;can be made, subtraction facts will be much easier for children to learn. As with addition facts, it is helpful to begin with facts that have totals of 10 or less (e.g., 8 &#8211; 3, 9 &#8211; 7) before working on facts that have a total higher than 10 (e.g., 13 &#8211; 4).</p>

<p>A think addition model for subtraction facts. Connecting subtraction to addition knowledge steps. First count out 13 and cover, a counting mat is covered. Next count and remove 5, keep these in view. a counting mat is covered with an arrow pointing to 5 counters. Think: 5 and what makes 13? 8, 8 left. 13 minus 5 is 8. Then uncover, a rectangle has 8 counters and a set of 5 counters to the right, 8 and 5 is 13.</p>
</details>
<p>The value of think-addition cannot be overstated. However, if children are to effectively use the think-addition strategy, they first must master the basic addition facts. Evidence suggests that children learn very few, if any, subtraction facts without first mastering the corresponding addition facts. So, for example, mastery of 3 + 5 is prerequisite knowledge for learning the facts 8 &#8211; 3 and 8 &#8211; 5.</p>
<p>Story problems that promote think-addition are those that sound like addition but have a missing addend: <em>join, start unknown; join, change unknown;</em> and <em>part&#8211;part&#8211;whole, part unknown</em> (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>). Consider this problem:</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_edi05">
<p>Janice had 5 fish in her aquarium. Grandma gave her some more fish. Then she had 12 fish. How many fish did Grandma give Janice?</p>
</aside>
<p>Notice that the action is <em>join</em> and, thus, suggests addition. There is a high probability that children will think, &#8220;Five and how many more make 12?&#8221; In the discussion in which you use problems such as this, your task is to connect this thought process with the subtraction fact, 12 &#8211; 5. Children may use the Making 10 strategy to solve this problem, just as they did with the addition facts. For example, they may think, &#8220;It takes 5 to get to 10 and 2 more to get to 12, so that&#8217;s 7.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before reading further, look at these three subtraction facts and reflect on the thought processes you use to get the answers. Even if you &#8220;just know them&#8221; think about what a likely process might be.</p>
