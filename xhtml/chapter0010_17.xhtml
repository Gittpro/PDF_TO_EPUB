        </header>
        <p><span id="page195" class="pagebreak" title="195" />There are two ways to think about Down Under 10. The first
            is to think about it as a &#8220;separate&#8221; situation. For 14 &#8211; 8, first take away 4 from 14 to
            equal 10, then take away 4 more, which is 6. Another way to think about this is as a
            &#8220;comparison&#8221; or &#8220;finding the difference or distance&#8221; between the two numbers. In
            other words, how far apart are 14 and 8? From 14, jump down 4 to the 10 and 2 more to the 8&#8212;they are 6
            apart. These two interpretations are illustrated in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0010_17.xhtml#fig_10-7">Figure 10.7</a>.</p>

        <p>Down Under 10 is a derived fact strategy because children use what they know (that 14 minus 10 is 4) to
            derive a related fact (14 &#8211; 8). Like the Combinations of 10 and Making 10 strategies discussed
            previously, this strategy is emphasized in high-performing countries but not emphasized enough in the United
            States (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_320" >Fuson &amp; Kwon, 1992</a>).</p>
        <p>One way to develop the Down Under 10 strategy is to give children pairs of facts in which the difference for
            the first fact is 10 and the second fact is either 8 or 9 (e.g., 16 &#8211; 6 and 16 &#8211; 7; 14 &#8211; 4
            and 14 &#8211; 6). Have children solve each pair of problems and discuss their strategies. If children do
            not naturally see the relationship, ask them to think about how the first fact can help them solve the
            second. Use a number line to illustrate the reasoning used. You can also pose story problems such as the
            following to elicit the Down Under 10 strategy:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_edi06">
            <p>Bekah had 15 bracelets. She gave 6 to a friend. How many does Bekah have left? (Separate)</p>
            <p>Bekah rode her bike for 15 minutes. Fabi rode her bike for 9 minutes. How many more minutes did Bekah
                ride than Fabi? (Comparison)</p>

                        class="ulink">Double Ten-Frame</a> (Blackline Master 15) with chips covering the first
                ten-frame and some of the second (e.g., for 16, cover 10 in the first frame and 6 on the second frame).
                Tell children these chips represent apples that were in a tree but that some apples have fallen to the
                ground&#8212;you will tell them how many have fallen and they will tell you how many are still in the
                tree. Ask children to explain their thinking. Repeat this activity multiple times with different amounts
                of apples. For ELLs or culturally diverse children, you can change to a context that is familiar.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>You can also use children&#8217;s literature to offer contexts to work on reasoning strategies. For example,
            <em>One Less Fish</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_341" >Toft &amp; Sheather,
                1998</a>) is a beautiful book with an important environmental message that starts with 12 fish and
            counts back to zero fish. On a page with 8 fish, ask, &#8220;How many fish are gone?&#8221; and &#8220;How
            did you figure it out?&#8221; Encourage children to use the Down Under 10 strategy. Any counting-up or
            counting-back book can be used in this way!</p>
