<h2 class="title">Reinforcing Basic Fact Mastery</h2>
</header>
<p>When children &#8220;just know&#8221; a fact or can apply a reasoning strategy so quickly that they almost don&#8217;t realize they have done it, they have reached phase 3: mastery. CCSS-M refers to this as &#8220;know from memory&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_317" >CCSSO, 2010</a>, p. 19) and the expectation is that children by the end of second grade will know from memory their basic facts for addition and subtraction. Repeated experiences with reasoning strategies are effective for committing facts to memory; memorizing is not. Therefore, games and activities that focus on reasoning strategies are more effective than drilling with f lash cards&#8212;and are more appealing to children.</p>
<p>When children do not become fluent with their basic facts, they will certainly struggle with multi-digit computation. Furthermore, children who do not know their facts often <span id="page199" class="pagebreak" title="199"/>struggle to understand more complex mathematical concepts because their cognitive energy must be spent on computation rather than on the more sophisticated concepts being developed (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_318" >Forbringer &amp; Fahsl, 2010</a>). Commit to using the effective strategies described in this chapter to ensure all children become fluent with their basic facts. When children are not developing fluency, do not resort to drill. Instead drop back to work on foundational ideas, such as number relationships.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="chap10-head3_21">Supporting Basic Fact Fluency through Games</h3>
</header>
<p>Games are an excellent way to provide repeated and engaging experiences for children to learn their basic facts. Playing games that infuse reasoning strategies support children to be able to flexibly choose strategies, decide which strategy is the most appropriate for a given problem, and become more efficient and accurate in finding the answer. These are the four tenants of fluency described earlier in the chapter and are what it takes to become fluent with the basic facts. Also, games increase children&#8217;s involvement, encourage student-to-student interaction, and improve communication&#8212;all of which are related to improved academic achievement (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_309" >Bay-Williams &amp; Kling, 2014</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_318" >Forbringer &amp; Fahsl, 2010</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_328" >Kami &amp; Anderson, 2003</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_332" >Lewis, 2005</a>).</p>
<p>As you use games, focus on related clusters of facts and on what individual children need to practice. When appropriate, encourage children to self-monitor by creating their own game board or fact cards that include the facts they are working on (their personal &#8220;toughies&#8221;).</p>

<p>Place children in groups of three and give each group a deck of cards (omit face cards and use aces as ones). Two children draw a card without looking at it and place it on their forehead facing outward so the others can see it. The child with no cards tells the sum of the two cards. The first of the other two children to correctly say the number on their forehead &#8220;wins&#8221; the card set. For ELLs, children with disabilities, or reluctant learners, speed can increase anxiety and inhibit participation. You can remove the issue of speed by having children write down the card they think they have (within 5 seconds) and getting a point if they are correct. This activity can be differentiated by including only certain cards (e.g., addition facts using only the numbers 1 through 5).</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M:1.OA.B.4; 1.OA.C.6; 2.OA.B.2</strong></p>
<p>Create a set of missing-number cards with fact families for each pair of children in your class (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_23.xhtml#fig_10-9">Figure 10.9(a)</a>). Begin this activity as a whole class and then move to partners. Show children one of the cards and ask why they think the numbers go together and why one number is circled. When this number family idea is understood, draw a different card and cover one of the numbers with your thumb, asking, &#8220;What is under my thumb?&#8221; Ask children to name the missing number and explain their thinking. After you have modeled this process, children can do this activity with partners. Have children create their own cards based on the facts they need to practice. They can also work alone with cards like the ones in <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_23.xhtml#fig_10-9">Figure 10.9(b)</a> where the answer is written on the back. Alternatively, you can use strips for the missing-number cards instead of circles, such as those in <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_23.xhtml#fig_10-9">Figure 10.9(c)</a>.</p>

<p>The first example of missing number cards has three circles. Each circle has three values with one circled. Values are 8, 5 and circled 13; 5, 9 and circled 14; 3, 4 and circled 7. Questions for children: Why do these numbers belong together? Why is one circled? The second example has three circles. Each circle has three values with one value a question mark, and one value circled. Values are 3, 6, and circled question mark; 4, question mark and circled 10; 4, question mark and circled 13. Questions for children: Which number is missing? How can you tell what it is? The third example has six rectangles each with two values in different locations, a blank and one circle on each rectangle. Values are 6, empty circle, 8; circled 11, blank, 4; blank, 6, circled 12; blank, 7 circled 14; circled 8, blank, 3; blank, circled 9, 6. Questions for children: these missing number cards are just like the number families. What is the missing number?</p>
</details>
<p><span id="page200" class="pagebreak" title="200"/>As a follow-up to <a class="xref" href="#ch10_act16">Activity 10.16</a>, children can complete &#8220;cards&#8221; on a <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Missing-Number_Worksheet.pdf" class="ulink">Missing-Number Worksheet</a>. On the worksheet, fill in two of the three numbers for a set of facts. You can create differentiated worksheets for children using clusters of facts that each child is ready to work on. An example is shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0010_23.xhtml#fig_10-10">Figure 10.10</a> where Make 10 facts are in one column, Near-Doubles facts make up the middle column, and in the third column are combinations from two fact families. Have children write an equation for each missing-number card. This helps children connect the missing addend problems to subtraction.</p>

<p>As children are engaged in games and activities, interview them to determine whether they are using counting strategies, reasoning strategies, or quick recall. Ask them to tell you what strategy they just used. If you observe counting, ask the child to try a particular reasoning strategy. If children are counting, more experiences to develop number relationships, such as activities with ten-frames and arithmetic racks, are needed.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Bingo</td>
<td>Each bingo card has a fact problem (e.g., 2 + 3 in each box. The same fact will be on multiple bingo cards but in different locations on each card. You will call out an answer (e.g., 6), and the children will find a matching problem (or more than one problem) on their card.</td>
<td>Create bingo boards that focus on different clusters of facts (e.g., doubles or doubles +1 on some boards, and Making 10 on other boards). Be sure that the answers you call out are an even mix of the clusters so that everyone has the same chance to win. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concentration</td>
<td>Create cards that have a fact problem (e.g., 6 + 7) on one half and the answers (e.g., 13) on the other half. Shuffle the cards and turn them face-down in a 6 &#215; 4 grid. (If you like, you can make the grid larger to use more cards.)</td>
<td>Select cards that focus on a particular cluster of facts (e.g., +1 and doubles) for each round of the game. Multiple groups can play the game simultaneously&#8212;each group will use the parts of the deck that contain the facts they are working on. Also, consider making cards that show the ten-frames below the numbers to help provide a visual for children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dominoes</td>
<td>Create (or find online) dominoes that have a fact on one side and an answer (not to that fact) on the other. Each gets the same number or dominoes (around eight). On his or her turn, they can play one of the dominoes in their hand only if they have an answer or a fact that can connect to a domino on the board.</td>
<td>As with other games, select the dominoes that focus on a particular clusters of facts. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Four in a Row</td>
<td>Create a 6 &#215; 6 square game board with a sum written on each square. Below, list the numbers 0 through 9. Each of the two players has counters of a different color to use as their game pieces. On the first turn, Player l places a marker (paper clip) on two addends and then gets to place his or her colored counter on the related answer. (If you have repeated the same answer on different squares of the board, the player only gets to cover one of them.) Player 2 can only move one paper clip and then gets to place his or her colored counter on the related answer, The first player to get four in a row wins.</td>
<td>Rather than list all the values below the chart, just list the related addends. For example, use 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 if you want to work on +1 and +2.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Old Maid (retitled as Old Dog)</td>
<td>Create cards for each fact and each answer. Add one card that has a picture of an old dog (or use your school mascot). Shuffle and deal cards. On each player&#8217;s turn, they draw from the person on their right, see whether that card is a match to a card in their hand (a fact and its answer), and, if so, lay down the pair. Then the person to their left draws from them. Play continues until all matches are found and someone is left with the Old Dog. Winner can be the person with (or not with) the Old Dog, or the person with the most pairs.</td>
<td>See Concentration (above).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Go Fish for 10</td>
<td>Create a set with 44 cards: 4 sets of cards with a digit 0&#8211;10 on it. Children can play in pairs or in small groups. Instead of &#8220;fishing&#8221; for pairs of like cards, children look for pairs of cards that sum to 10. For example, if they have a 6 in their hand, they can ask, &#8220;Do you have a 4?&#8221;</td>
<td>Remove some of the cards to focus the game on facts children need to work on. Add cards with larger numbers to work on sums greater than 10.</td>

<p>For this activity (modified from <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_340" >Shoecraft, 1982</a>), create a game board by drawing circles placed in triangular fashion to look like bowling pins, with the front circle labeled 1 and the others labeled consecutively through 10. Give children the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Bowl-a-Fact.pdf" class="ulink">Bowl-A-Fact</a> Activity Page so they can record their equations. For culturally diverse classrooms be sure that children are familiar with bowling. (If they are not, consider showing a YouTube clip or photographs.)</p>
<figure class="figure lc_img33 fx-lightbox">
<img alt="A set of 10 circles are arranged in a triangular shape, with the apex pointing downward. Circles are numbered as follows, from bottom to top: row 1, 1; row 2, 2 and 3; row 3; 4, 5, 6; row 4, 7, 8, 9, 10." src="../images/unfig10-07.png"></img>
</figure>
<p>Take three dice and roll them. Children use addition and/or subtraction with at least two of the numbers on the three dice to come up with equations that result in answers that are on the pins. For example, if you roll 4, 2, and 3 they can &#8220;knock down&#8221; the 3 pin with 4 + 2 &#8211; 3. They can also knock down the 7 pin with 4 + 3. If they can produce equations to knock down all 10 pins, they get a strike. If not, roll again and see whether they can knock the rest down for a spare. After doing this with the whole class, children can work in small groups. To decrease the challenge, roll four dice at a time.</p>
