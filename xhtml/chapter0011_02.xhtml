<h2 class="title">Developing Foundational Ideas in Whole-Number Place Value</h2>
</header>
<p>Place-value understanding requires an <em>integration</em> of new and sometimes difficult-to-construct concepts of grouping by tens (the base-ten concept) with procedural knowledge of how groups are recorded in our place-value system and how numbers are written and spoken. Note that learners must understand the word <em>grouping</em> in the context of place value, especially English language learners (ELLs) who may become confused because the root word <em>group</em> is often used to instruct children to work together.</p>

<p>Children may attach words to both materials and groups without realizing what the materials or symbols represent. Look for evidence or counter-evidence of this level of understanding as children work on tasks.</p>

</header>
<p>Each of the sets in <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_02.xhtml#fig_11-1">Figure 11.1</a> has 35 tiles, but each set is organized differently. Before base-ten ideas develop, counting by ones is the only approach by which children can be convinced that all three sets are the same amount. Once children can count out a set of 35 by ones, help them see that making groupings of tens and leftovers is a way of counting that same quantity. <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_02.xhtml#fig_11-1">Figure 11.1</a> shows three distinct stages of understanding related to base-ten groupings that children move through as they reason about grouping quantities.<span id="page209" class="pagebreak" title="209"/></p>

<p>There is a subtle, yet profound, difference between children at these stages: Some know that set B in <a class="xref" href="#fig_11-1">Figure 11.1</a> is 35 because they understand the idea that 3 groups of ten and 5 more is the same amount as 35 counted by ones; others simply say, &#8220;It&#8217;s 35,&#8221; because they have been told that when things are grouped this way, it&#8217;s called 35. The children who understand place value will see no need to count set B by ones. They understand the &#8220;thirty-fiveness&#8221; of sets A and B to be the same. The children in the pre&#8211;place-value stage may not be sure how many they will get if they count the tiles in set B by ones or if the groups were &#8220;ungrouped&#8221; how many there would then be.</p>

<p>Your foremost objective should be helping children integrate what they already know about numbers from counting by ones with the grouping-by-tens concept. If they only count by ones, ask them, &#8220;What will happen if we count these by groups and singles (or by tens and ones)?&#8221; If a set has been grouped into tens and singles and counted, then ask, &#8220;How can we be really certain that there are 35 things here?&#8221; or &#8220;How many do you think we will get if we count by ones?&#8221; You cannot just tell children that these counts will all be the same and hope that will make sense to them&#8212;it is a relationship they must construct themselves.</p>

<p>What are some defining characteristics of &#8220;pre&#8211;place-value&#8221; children and children who understand place value?</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page210" class="pagebreak" title="210"/>Groupings with fewer than the maximum number of tens are referred to as <em>equivalent groupings</em> or <em>equivalent representations</em>. Understanding the equivalence of sets B and C indicates a realization that grouping by tens is not just a rule that is followed, but that any grouping by tens, along with the singles, can help tell how many. Many computational techniques (e.g., regrouping in addition and subtraction) are based on equivalent representations of numbers.</p>

<p>Children&#8217;s ability to label place values with base-ten names (e.g., ones, tens, hundreds) does not guarantee that they understand that 1 ten is the same as 10 ones or that 1 hundred is the same as 10 tens.</p>
