</header>
<p>The symbolic scheme that we use for writing numbers (ones on the right, tens to the left of ones, and so on) must be coordinated with the grouping scheme. Activities can be designed so that children physically associate groupings of tens and ones with the correct recording of the individual digits, as <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_04.xhtml#fig_11-2">Figure 11.2</a> illustrates.</p>

<p>A counting mat has 5 groups of 10 objects with a 5 below, and a group of 3 objects with a 3 below. Arrows point from the mat to a 2 by 2 place value chart and to 5 tens and 3 ones. The place value chart has headings, tens and ones with a 5 in the tens column and 3 in the ones column. Arrows point from the place value chart and 5 tens and 3 ones to an oval that contains 53.</p>
</details>
<p>Language again plays a key role in making these connections. The explicit count by groups and singles matches the individual digits as the number is written in the usual left-to-right manner. A similar coordination is necessary for hundreds and other place values. <span id="page211" class="pagebreak" title="211"/>Keep in mind that children will find it initially challenging to see &#8220;ten&#8221; as both 10 ones and 1 ten.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="chapter0011_04.xhtml#fig_11-3">Figure 11.3</a> summarizes the ideas of integrated place-value understanding that have been discussed so far. Note that all three methods of counting (from <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_02.xhtml#fig_11-1">Figure 11.1</a>) are coordinated as the principal method of integrating the base-ten concepts, the written names, and the oral names.</p>

<p>A diagram of base ten concepts, oral names and written names for numbers. Base ten concepts has 2 groups of base ten blocks. The first group has 3 rods and 2 bits, and the second group has 2 rods and 12 bits with standard and equivalent groupings meaningfully used to represent quantities. Oral names, in standard form is thirty-two and base ten form is three tens and two. The written name is 32. Double-headed arrows connect each group with a centered list of 3 ways to count: by ones, by groups and singles, and by tens and ones.</p>
