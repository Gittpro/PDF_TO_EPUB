<h2 class="title">Base-Ten Models for Place Value</h2>
</header>
<p>Note that when children are working on base-ten concepts, they combine multiplicative understanding (each piece is ten times the value of the place to the right) with a positional system (each place has a value)&#8212;something hard to do prior to multiplication being taught! Physical models for base-ten concepts support the development of place value and base-ten understanding. Physical models also play a key role in helping children develop the idea of &#8220;a ten&#8221; as both a single entity and as a set of 10 units. Remember, though, that the physical models do not &#8220;show&#8221; the concept to the children. The children must mentally construct the &#8220;ten makes one&#8221; relationship and impose it on the model.</p>
<p>An effective, base-ten model for ones, tens, and hundreds is one that is <em>proportional</em>. That is, a model for ten is physically ten times larger than the model for a one, and a model for one hundred is ten times larger than the ten model. Proportional models allow children to verify that ten of any given piece is equivalent to one piece in the column to the left (e.g., 10 tens equals 1 hundred). Base-ten proportional models can be categorized as <em>groupable</em> or <em>pregrouped</em>.</p>

<p>Models that most clearly ref lect the relationships of ones, tens, and hundreds are those for which children can build a place-value piece from other place-value pieces and verify it&#8217;s value&#8212;for example, the ten can actually be made or grouped from the single pieces. When children put 10 beans in a cup, the cup of 10 beans literally <em>is the same as</em> the 10 single beans. Bundles of wooden craft sticks or coffee stirrers can be grouped with rubber bands. Plastic linking cubes can be built into bars of ten and also provide a good transition to pregrouped rods because they form a similar shape. Examples of these groupable models are shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_05.xhtml#fig_11-4">Figure 11.4(a)</a>.</p>

<p>Set Ay, groupable base ten models include the following. Counters and cups: Ten single counters are placed in a portion cup. Hundreds: ten cups in a margarine tub. Cubes: Ten single cubes form a bar of 10. Hundreds: ten bars on cardboard backing. Bundles of sticks, wooden craft sticks, coffee stirrers: If bundles are left intact, these are a pregrouped model. Hundreds: ten bundles grouped with a rubber band. Set b, pregrouped base ten models include the following: Strips and squares: Make from cardstock. Plastic versions are available through catalogs Base-ten blocks: Wooden or plastic units, longs, flats, and blocks. Expensive, durable, easily handled, the only model with 1000. Little ten-frame cards: Good for illustrating how far to the next multiple often. Ones are not loose but are organized in a ten-frame. No model for 100. Inexpensive and easy to make.</p>
</details>
<p>When children become more familiar with these models, collections of tens can be made in advance by the children and kept as ready-made tens (e.g., craft sticks can be left bundled, linking cubes can be left connected). This is a good transition to the pregrouped models described in the next section.</p>

<p>As children begin to make groupings of ten, start introducing the language of &#8220;tens&#8221; by matching the objects being used, such as &#8220;cups of ten and ones&#8221; or &#8220;bundles of ten and singles.&#8221; Then move to a general phrase, such as &#8220;groups of ten and ones.&#8221; Eventually you can abbreviate &#8220;groups of tens&#8221; as &#8220;tens&#8221; such as &#8220;four tens and seven.&#8221;</p>
