<h2 class="title">Developing Base-Ten Concepts</h2>
</header>
<p>Now that you have a sense of the important place-value concepts, we turn to activities that assist children in developing these concepts. This section focuses on base-ten concepts or grouping by tens (see the top of <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_04.xhtml#fig_11-3">Figure 11.3</a>). Connecting this important idea with the oral and written names for numbers (the rest of <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_04.xhtml#fig_11-3">Figure 11.3</a>) is discussed separately to help you focus on how to do each. However, in the classroom, the oral and written names for numbers can and should be developed in concert with conceptual ideas.</p>

<p>Ref lect for a moment on how strange it must sound to say &#8220;seven ones.&#8221; Certainly, children have never said they were &#8220;seven ones&#8221; years old. The use of the word <em>ten</em> as a singular group name is even more mysterious. Consider the phrase &#8220;Ten ones makes one ten.&#8221; The first <em>ten</em> carries the usual meaning of 10 things, the amount that is 1 more than 9 things. But the other <em>ten</em> is a singular noun, one thing. How can something the child has known for years as the name for a lot of things suddenly become one thing? And if you think this is confusing for native speakers, imagine the potential difficulty for ELLs.</p>
<p>Because children start their development of base-ten concepts with a count-by-ones idea of number, you must begin there. You cannot arbitrarily impose grouping by ten on children. <span id="page214" class="pagebreak" title="214"/>Children need to experiment with gathering objects into groups of like size and perhaps come to an agreement that ten is a very useful size to use. The following activity could be done in kindergarten or first grade as an example of a first effort at developing grouping concepts.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: K.NBT.A.1; 1.NBT.B.2a</strong></p>
<p>Find a collection of items between 25 and 100 that children might be interested in counting&#8212;perhaps the number of shoes in the classroom, a tub of cubes, the number of crayons in the classroom crayon box, or the number of books in the classroom library. Suppose the children decide to count the number of shoes. Then pose the question,
&#8220;How could we count our shoes in some way that would be easier than counting by ones?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever suggestions children pose, try them. After testing several methods, you can have a discussion about what worked well and what did not. If no one suggests counting by tens, you might casually suggest that as an idea to try.</p>

<p>One teacher challenged her children to find a good way to count all the linking cubes being held by the class after each child had been given a cube for each of their pockets. The first suggestion was to count by sevens. That was tried but did not work very well because none of the children could count by sevens. In search of a more efficient way, the next suggestion was to count by twos. This did not seem to be much better than counting by ones. Finally, they settled on counting by tens and realized that this was a good and relatively &#8220;fast&#8221; way of counting.</p>
<p>This and similar activities provide you with the opportunity to suggest to children to arrange materials into groups of tens before they start the &#8220;fast&#8221; way of counting. Remember that children may count &#8220;ten, twenty, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two&#8221; but not fully realize the &#8220;thirty-two-ness&#8221; of the quantity. To connect the count-by-tens method with their understood method of counting by ones, the children need to count both ways and discuss why they get the same result.</p>
<p>The idea in the next activity is for children to make groups of ten and record or say the amounts. Number words are used so that children will not mechanically match tens and ones with individual digits.</p>

<p>Prepare bags of different types of objects such as toothpicks, buttons, beans, plastic chips, linking cubes, craft sticks, or other items. Children should use the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Bag_of_Tens.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Bag of Tens</strong></a> Activity Page, a recording sheet similar to the top example in <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_08.xhtml#fig_11-5">Figure 11.5</a>. The bags can be placed at stations around the room or given to pairs of children. Children empty the bags and count the contents. The amount is recorded as a number word. Then the objects are grouped in as many tens as possible. The groups are recorded on the form. After returning the objects to the bags, bags are traded or children move to another station. Note that children with disabilities may initially need to use a ten-frame to support their counting. Then the use of the ten-frame should eventually fade.</p>

<p>The first activity example is a 4 by 3 table with the first column having names of objects, bag of toothpicks, beans and washers. The second column is labeled number word and the third column has a blank for tens and a blank for singles. The second activity, get this many, has a pattern of dots with a box to the right, write the number word, a blank for tens and a blank for ones. The third activity, fill the tens, has a set of ten, ten frames in 2 rows of 5, with directions, get forty-seven beans. Fill up ten frames. Draw dots, with a blank for tens and blank for extras. The fourth activity, loop this many, has an array of 4 by 33 dots, with directions loop sixty-two in groups of ten, and a blank space under the array for tens and a blank space for ones.</p>

<p><span id="page215" class="pagebreak" title="215"/>Variations of the &#8220;Groups of Ten&#8221; activity are suggested by the other recording sheets in <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_08.xhtml#fig_11-5">Figure 11.5</a>.

Provide small cups to put the groups of ten in. Notice that the activity requires children to first count the set in a way they understand (e.g., count by ones), record the amount in words, and then make the groupings. The <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Fill_the_Tens.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Fill the Tens</strong></a> and <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Loop_This_Many.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Loop This Many</strong></a> Activity Pages begin with a verbal name (number word), and children must count the indicated amount and then make groups.</p>
<p>The following activity is another variant of the grouping activities but includes an estimation component that adds interest, makes the activity more problem based, and contributes to number sense. Listening to children&#8217;s estimates is a useful assessment opportunity that tells you a lot about children&#8217;s concept of numbers.</p>

<p>Give children a length that they are going to measure&#8212;for example, the length of a child lying down or the distance around the edge of a sheet of newspaper. At one end of the length, line up 10 units (e.g., 10 linking cubes, toothpicks, rods, or blocks). On a recording sheet (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_08.xhtml#fig_11-6">Figure 11.6</a> and the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_How_Long.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>How Long?</strong></a> Activity Page), children record an estimate of how many groups of 10 and ones they think will match the length. Next they find the actual measure, placing units along the full length. These are counted by ones and also grouped in tens. Both results are recorded. Estimating the groups of ten requires children to pay attention to the ten as a group or unit. Notice that all three place-value components from <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_04.xhtml#fig_11-3">Figure 11.3</a> are included. Children work in pairs to measure several lengths around the room. <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Expanded_Lesson_Estimating_Groups_of_Tens_and_Ones.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Click here</strong></a> for an Expanded Lesson for this activity.</p>

<p>To learn a lot about your children&#8217;s base-ten concept development use a class <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM33_Observation_Checklist.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Observation Checklist</strong></a> to record observations about how children do these activities. For example, how do children count the objects? Do they make groupings of ten? Do they count to 10 and then start again at 1? Children who count in these ways are already using the base-ten structure. But what you may likely see early on is children counting a full set without stopping at tens and without any effort to organize the materials in groups. If you notice this behavior, use a diagnostic interview and ask the child to count a jar of small beans (between 30 and 50 beans) and record the number. Ask the child, &#8220;If you were to place each group of 10 beans in a small cup, how many cups would you need?&#8221; If a child has no idea or makes random guesses, what would you know about the child&#8217;s knowledge of place value?</p>
