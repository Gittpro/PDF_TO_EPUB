</header>
<p>In second grade, numbers up to 1000 become important (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_348" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). Here the issue is not one of connecting a count-by-ones approach to a group of 100 but rather seeing the number in multiple ways, including as 100 single objects, as 10 tens, and as a singular unit. In textbooks these relationships are often presented on one page showing how 10 rods of ten can be put together to make 1 hundred piece. This quick demonstration may be lost on many children. Additionally, the word <em>hundred</em> is equally strange and can get even less attention. These word names are not as simple as they seem!</p>
<p><span id="page217" class="pagebreak" title="217"/><em>The 100th Day of School from the Black Lagoon</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_358" >Thaler, 2014</a>) and <em>100th Day Worries</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_347" >Cuyler, 2005</a>) are two children&#8217;s books that focus on the 100th day of school, which is one way to explore the benchmark number of 100. Through a variety of ways to think about 100 (such as collections of 100 items), children can use these stories to think about the relative size of 100 or ways to make 100 using a variety of combinations.</p>
<p>To reinforce the idea that a hundred is a group of 10 tens and also 100 singles, consider the estimation activity &#8220;Too Many Tens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Show children any quantity with 150 to 1000 items. For example, you might use a jar of lima beans, a clear bag of plastic beads, a long chain of connecting links or paper clips, a box of Styrofoam packing peanuts, or a grocery bag full of straws. First, have children make and record estimates of how many beads, for example, are in the bag. Discuss how children determined their estimates. Then distribute portions of the beads to pairs or triads of children to put into cups of 10 beads. Collect leftover beads and put these into groups of ten as well. Now ask, &#8220;How can we use these groups of ten to tell how many beads we have? Can we make new groups from the groups of ten? What is 10 groups of ten called?&#8221; Be prepared with some larger containers or baggies into which 10 cups (or other collections of 10 tens) can be placed. When all groups are made, count the hundreds, the tens, and the ones separately. Record the totals on the board as &#8220;<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math217.png" alttext="4 space hundreds space plus space 7 space tens space plus space 8 space ones." altimg-height="36" altimg-width="199" class="informalequation">

<p>In this activity, it is important to use a groupable model so that children can see how the 10 groups of ten are the same as 100 individual items. At first, you may think this activity will take too much time. But this activity helps cement the connection that is often lost in the rather simple display of a hundreds f lat or a paper hundreds square in the pregrouped base-ten models.</p>
