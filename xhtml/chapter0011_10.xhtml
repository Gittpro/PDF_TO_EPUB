</header>
<p>An important variation of the grouping activities is aimed at the equivalent representations of numbers. For example, pose the following task to children who have just completed the &#8220;Groups of Ten&#8221; activity (<a class="xref" href="chapter0011_08.xhtml#ch11-Activity-11-2">Activity 11.2</a>).</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_01">
<p>What is another way you can show 42 besides 4 groups of ten and 2 singles? Let&#8217;s see how many ways you can find.</p>
</aside>
<p>Interestingly, most children will go next to 42 singles. The following activities focus on creating additional equivalent representations.</p>

<p>Show a collection of materials that is only partly grouped in sets of ten. For example, you may have 5 chains of 10 links and 17 additional unconnected links. Be sure the children understand that each chain has 10 links. Have children count the number of chains and the number of singles in any way they wish to count. Ask, &#8220;How many in all?&#8221; Record all responses and discuss how they got their answers. Next, before their very eyes, change the groupings (make a ten from the singles or break apart one of the tens) and repeat the questions and discussion. Do not change the total number from one time to the next. Once children begin to understand that the total does not change, ask in what other ways the items could be grouped if you use tens and ones.</p>

<p><span id="page218" class="pagebreak" title="218"/>If you are teaching second grade, equivalent representations for hundreds as groups of tens can help children with the concept of a hundred as 10 tens. The next activity is similar to &#8220;Can You Make the Link?,&#8221; but it is done using pregrouped materials and includes hundreds.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: 2.NBT.A.1; 2.NBT.A.3; K.CC.B.5</strong></p>
<p>Children work in groups or pairs. First, they show 463 on their desks with base-ten materials in the standard representation (i.e., 4 hundreds pieces, 6 sticks of ten, and 3 ones). Next, they find and record at least three other ways of representing this quantity. As a variation, challenge children to find a way to show an amount with a specific number of pieces. For example, &#8220;Can you show 463 with 31 pieces?&#8221; (There is more than one way to do this.)</p>
</aside>
<p>Although <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_345" >Burris (2013)</a> identified benefits of using both virtual and physical base-ten manipulatives, he found virtual base-ten blocks more readily supported children as they explored nonstandard representations of numbers for a couple of reasons. (He used the virtual place value blocks from Scott Foresman&#8217;s <em>eTools</em>.) First, children were able to compose and decompose numbers more quickly with the virtual blocks than with the physical blocks and so were able to generate many more different representations. And second, the virtual site included a place value mat that displayed the number represented by the base-ten blocks. As the base-ten blocks changed, the number remained the same, reinforcing the idea that the representations were indeed equivalent.</p>
<p>When children have had sufficient experiences with pregrouped materials, a semi-concrete &#8220;square-line-dot&#8221; notation can be used for recording hundreds, tens, and ones (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_10.xhtml#fig_11-7">Figure 11.7</a> and the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Square_Line_Dot.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Square Line Dot</strong></a> Activity Page). Use the drawings to reinforce the notion of unitizing (i.e., <em>one</em> ten, <em>one</em> hundred) and also as a suggestion for how children can record their reasoning and results.</p>

<p>Two equivalent representation exercises.

The second box has the question, how much? and directions, show another way, with a group in a rectangle of 6 dots, 2 squares, 6 lines, 2 squares, 6 dots, and 12 lines.

<p>Base-ten riddles can be presented orally or in written form (see <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Base-Ten_Riddles.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Base-Ten Riddle Cards</strong></a>). In either case, children should use base-ten materials to help solve the riddles. The examples here illustrate different levels of difficulty. After children solve these riddles, have them write new ones:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>I have 23 ones and 4 tens. Who am I?</p></li>
<li><p>I have 4 hundreds, 12 tens, and 6 ones. Who am I?</p></li>
<li><p>I have 30 ones and 3 hundreds. Who am I?</p></li>
<li><p>I am 45. I have 25 ones. How many tens do I have?</p></li>
<li><p>I am 341. I have 22 tens. How many hundreds do I have?</p></li>
<li><p>I have 13 tens, 2 hundreds, and 21 ones. Who am I?</p></li>
<li><p>If you put 3 more tens with me, I would be 115. Who am I?</p></li>
<li><p>I have 17 ones. I am between 40 and 50. Who am I? How many tens do I have?</p></li>
