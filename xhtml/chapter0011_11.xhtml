        <p><span id="page219" class="pagebreak" title="219" />In this section, we focus on helping children connect oral
            and written names for numbers (see bottom of <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_04.xhtml#fig_11-3">Figure
                11.3</a>) with their emerging base-ten concepts of using groups of 10 or 100 as efficient methods of
            counting. Note that the ways we say and write numbers are conventions, not concepts. Children must learn
            these by being told rather than through problem-based activities.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that for ELLs, the convention or pattern in our English number words is likely
                not the same as it is in their native language, especially for the numbers 11 to 19.</p>

        </header>
        <p>In kindergarten and first grade, children need to connect the base-ten concepts with the oral number names
            they have repeatedly used. They know the words but may have not thought of them in terms of tens and ones.
            In fact, early on they may want to write twenty-one as 201.</p>
        <p>When teaching oral names, you will almost always want to use base-ten models. Initially, rather than use
            standard number words, use the more explicit base-ten language (e.g.,
            &#8220;4 tens and 7 ones&#8221; instead of &#8220;forty-seven&#8221;). Base-ten language is rarely
            misunderstood. When it seems appropriate, begin to pair base-ten language with standard language. Emphasize
            the teens as exceptions. Acknowledge that they are formed &#8220;backward&#8221; and do not fit the
            patterns. The next activity helps introduce oral names for numbers.</p>

            <p>Show some tens (using base-ten pieces) on the projector or just place them on the carpet in a mixed
                arrangement. Ask how many tens. Add or remove a ten and repeat the question. Next add some ones. Always
                have children give the base-ten name and the standard name. (Refer children to examples of the base-ten
                name and the corresponding standard name that you have posted on the math word wall. These examples will
                be helpful for any ELLs and children with disabilities in your class.) Continue to make changes in the
                materials displayed by adding or removing 1 or 2 tens and by adding and removing ones. Avoid the
                standard left-to-right order for tens and ones so the emphasis is on the names of the materials, not the
                order they are in.</p>
            <p>Reverse the activity by having children use base-ten blocks at their desks. For example, say, &#8220;Make
                63.&#8221; The children make the number with the models and then give the base-ten name (6 tens and 3
                ones) and standard name (63).</p>

                fingers. Have the class count the fingers by tens and ones. Ask other children to show different
                numbers. Emphasize the number of sets of 10 fingers and the single fingers (base-ten language) and pair

            give the response you want, matching number words to models without actually thinking about the total
            quantities. Also, consider occasionally counting an entire representation by ones. Remember that counting by
            ones is the young child&#8217;s principal linkage with the concept of quantity. For example, suppose you
            have just had children use linking cubes to make 36. Try asking, &#8220;Do you think there really are 36
            blocks there?&#8221; Many children may not be convinced, so the count by ones is very significant.</p>
