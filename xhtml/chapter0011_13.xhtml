        <p>Place-value mats are simple mats divided into two or three sections to hold ones and tens or ones, tens, and
            hundreds pieces as shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_13.xhtml#fig_11-9">Figure 11.9</a>. You can
            suggest to children that the mats are a good way to organize their materials when working with <span
                id="page222" class="pagebreak" title="222" />base-ten blocks. Explain that the standard way to use a
            place-value mat is with the space for the ones on the right and tens and hundreds places to the left.</p>

            <p>Two place-value mats each with 2 ten frames in the ones place. The first mat has cups and beans to show
                53 on the place value mat with 5 cups of ten beans in the tens section of the mat and 3 individual beans
                in one of the ten frames. The second mat has strips and squares to show 237 on the place value mat with
                two 10 by 10 arrays of squares in the hundreds section, 3 strips of 10 squares in the tens sections and
                7 squares in one ten frame.</p>
        </details>
        <p>Although it is not commonly seen in textbooks, it is strongly recommended that two ten-frames be drawn in the
            ones place as shown on the <a
                href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM17_Place_Value_Mat_with_Ten-Frames.pdf"
                class="ulink"><strong>Place-Value Mat</strong></a>, Blackline Master 17. That way, the amount of ones on
            the ten-frames is always clearly evident, eliminating the need for repeatedly counting the ones. The
            ten-frame also makes it very clear how many additional ones are needed to make the next set of ten. If
            children are modeling two numbers at the same time, one ten-frame can be used for each number.</p>
        <p>Be aware of how easy it is for a child to show a number on a mat using base-ten blocks and learn to write the
            number without any understanding of what the number represents. First- and second-grade textbooks often show
            a picture of base-ten materials and have children record numbers in this manner:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_06">
            <p><u>7</u> tens and <u>3</u> ones is <u>7 3</u> in all.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>It is all too easy to copy down the number of rods and single blocks and rewrite these digits as a single
            number 73 and not confront what these symbols stand for. Consider the following approach to address this
            issue.</p>
        <p>As children use their place-value mats, they can be shown how the left-to-right order of the pieces is also
            the way that numbers are written. To show how the numbers are &#8220;built,&#8221; have a set of 27 <a

                class="ulink"><strong>Place Value Cards</strong></a>&#8212;one for each of the hundreds (100&#8211;900),
            one for each of the tens (10&#8211;90), and cards for 1 through 9 (see <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0011_13.xhtml#fig_11-10">Figure 11.10</a>). Notice that the cards are made so that the tens
            card is twice as long as the ones card and the hundreds card is three times as long as the ones card.</p>

        <p><span id="page223" class="pagebreak" title="223" />As children place the materials for a number (e.g., 457)
            on the place-value mat, have them also place the matching cards (e.g., 400, 50, and 7) below the materials.
            Then starting with the hundreds card, layer the others on top, right aligned. This approach will show how
            the number is built while allowing children to see the individual components of the number. This is
            especially helpful when there are zero tens. The place-value mat and the matching cards demonstrate the
            important link between the base-ten models and the written form of the numbers.</p>

            <p>To support children struggling with reading a number with an internal zero (i.e., zero tens), show or
                say, for example, 7 hundreds and 4 ones. Then the class says, &#8220;Seven hundreds, zero tens, and four
                ones, which is&#8212;seven hundred (slight pause) four.&#8221; The pause and the base-ten language
                suggest the correct reading of the three-digit number.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>The next two activities are designed to help children make connections between models, oral language (base
            ten and standard), and written forms. The activities can be done with two- or three-digit numbers depending
            on children&#8217;s needs.</p>

            <p>Display models of ones and tens (and hundreds, if appropriate) in a mixed arrangement. Use a projector,
                virtual manipulatives, or simply draw on the board using the square-line-dot method. Children say the
                amount shown in base-ten language (&#8220;four hundreds, one ten, and five ones&#8221;) and then in
                standard language (&#8220;four hundred fifteen&#8221;); next they enter it on their calculators or write
                it on a small whiteboard or on paper. Have someone share his or her display and defend it. Make a change
                in the materials and repeat. You can also do this activity by saying the standard name for a number and
                then having children use base-ten materials to show that number and then enter it on their calculators
                (or write it). Again, pay special attention to numbers in the teens (e.g., 13 and 419) and to the case
                of zero tens (e.g., 305). ELLs may need additional time to think of the words that go with the numbers,
                especially as the numbers get larger.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>The next activity is a wonderful challenge for children in early stages of place-value development. It can
            also be used as an assessment to see whether children really understand the value of digits in two- and
            three-digit numbers.</p>

            <p>Have children enter a specific two- or three-digit number on the calculator. The task is to change one of
                the digits in the number without simply entering the new number. For example, change 48 to 78. Change
                315 to 305 or to 295. Changes can be made by adding or subtracting an appropriate amount. Children
                should write or discuss explanations for their solutions. Children with disabilities may need the visual
                support of having cards that say &#8220;add ten&#8221; or &#8220;add one&#8221; first to explore how the
                number changes. They may also need to use base-ten materials to be able to conceptualize the number and
                then move to more abstract work using only the calculator. <span id="page224" class="pagebreak"

            <p>Children are often able to disguise their lack of place value understanding by following directions,
                using the tens and ones pieces in prescribed ways, and using the language of place value.</p>
            <p>The diagnostic tasks presented here are designed to help you look more closely at children&#8217;s
                understanding of the integration of the three components of place value. Designed as diagnostic
                interviews rather than whole-class activities, these tasks have been used by several researchers and are
                adapted primarily from <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_351" >Kami (1985)</a>,
                <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_352" >Labinowicz (1985)</a>, and <a
                    class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_355" >Ross (1986)</a>.</p>
            <p>The first interview task is referred to as the Digit Correspondence Task. Take out 36 blocks. Ask the
                child to count the blocks, and then have the child write the number that tells how many there are.
                Circle the 6 in 36 and ask, &#8220;Does this part of your 36 have anything to do with how many blocks
                there are?&#8221; Then circle the 3 and repeat the question. As with all diagnostic interviews, do not
                give clues. Based on responses to similar tasks, <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_356"
                    >Ross (1989</a>, <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_357"
                    >2002</a>) has identified five distinct levels of understanding of place
                value:</p>
            <ol class="numbered">
                <li>
                    <p><em>Single numeral.</em> The child writes 36 but views it as a single numeral. The individual
                        digits 3 and 6 have no meaning by themselves.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Position names.</em> The child correctly identifies the tens and ones positions but still
                        makes no connections between the individual digits and the blocks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Face value.</em> The child matches 6 blocks with the 6 and 3 blocks with the 3.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Transition to place value.</em> The 6 is matched with 6 blocks and the 3 with the remaining
                        30 blocks but not as 3 groups of 10.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><em>Full understanding.</em> The 3 is correlated with 3 groups of 10 blocks and the 6 with 6
                        single blocks.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>For the second interview, write the number 342. Have the child read the number. Then have the child write
                the number that is 1 more. Next, ask for the number that is 10 more. You may wish to explore further
                with models. One less and 10 less can be checked the same way. Observe whether the child is counting on
                or counting back or whether the child immediately knows that 10 more is 352. This interview can also be
                done with a two-digit number.</p>
            <p>A third interview can also provide interesting evidence of depth of understanding. Ask the child to write
                the number that represents 5 tens, 2 ones, and 3 hundreds. Note that the task does not give the places
                in order. What do you think will be the common misunderstanding? If the child does not write 352, then
                ask the child to show you the number with base-ten materials and to say what number they have with the
                materials. Compare to what they wrote previously, if different. What information can you obtain from the
                results of this interview?</p>
