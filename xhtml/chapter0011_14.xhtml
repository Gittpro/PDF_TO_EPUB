<h2 class="title">Patterns and Relationships with Multidigit Numbers</h2>
</header>
<p><span id="page226" class="pagebreak" title="226"/>
In this section, we focus on developing the relationships of numbers to special numbers called <em>benchmark numbers</em> and in ten-structured thinking&#8212;that is, f lexibility in using the structure of tens in our number system. These ideas begin to provide a basis for computation as children simultaneously strengthen their understanding of number relationships and place value.</p>

<h3 class="title" id="chap11-head3_13">The Hundreds Chart</h3>
</header>
<p>The hundreds chart (<a class="xref" href="chapter0011_14.xhtml#fig_11-11">Figure 11.11</a> and <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM3_Hundreds_Chart.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Blackline Master 3</strong></a>) is such an important tool in the development of place-value concepts that it deserves special attention. K&#8211;2 classrooms should have a hundreds chart displayed prominently and used often.</p>

<p>A useful version of a hundreds chart can be made of transparent pockets into which each of the 100 numeral cards can be inserted. You can hide a number in the chart by inserting a blank card in front of the number in the pocket. You can also insert colored pieces of paper in the slots to highlight various number patterns such as skip counting by 2 (even number), 5, and 10 (2.NBT.A.2). You can also remove some or all the number cards and have children return them to their correct positions. A blank 10 &#215; 10 grid (see <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM2_Blank_Hundreds_Chart.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Blackline Master 2</strong></a>) serves as an empty hundreds chart on which you can write numbers. Discuss the pattern shown on the chart as well as the patterns in the numbers.</p>
<p>In kindergarten and first grade, children can count and recognize two-digit numbers with the hundreds chart. In first and second grades, children can use the hundreds chart to develop base-ten understanding, noticing that jumps up or down are jumps of ten (1.NBT.C.4), while jumps to the right or left are jumps of one.</p>
<p>There are lots of patterns on the hundreds chart. During discussions, different children may describe the same pattern in several ways. Accept all ideas and encourage children to consider how these descriptions are similar and different. Here are some of the important place-value related patterns children may point out:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>The numbers in a column all end with the same number, which is the same as the number at the top of the chart.</p></li>
<li><p>In a row, the first number (tens digit) stays the same and the &#8220;second&#8221; number (ones digit) counts 1, 2, 3, . . . 9, 0) changes as you move across.</p></li>
<li><p>In a column, the first number (tens digit) &#8220;counts&#8221; or goes up by ones as you move down. &#8226; You can count by tens going down the far right-hand column.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting at 11 and moving down on the diagonal, you can find numbers with the same digit in the tens and ones (e.g., 11, 22, 33, 44, and so on).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For children, these patterns are not obvious or trivial. For example, one child may notice the pattern in the column under the 4&#8212;every number ends in a 4. Two minutes later, another child will &#8220;discover&#8221; the parallel pattern in the column headed by 7. That there is a pattern like this in every column may not be completely obvious.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve discussed some of the patterns on the chart, try <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_06.xhtml#ch08-Activity-8-33">Activity 8.33</a>, &#8220;Missing Numbers&#8221; in <a class="xref" href="chapter0008_00.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>.<span id="page227" class="pagebreak" title="227"/></p>

<p>Replacing the number cards from a blank chart is a good station activity for two children to try. By listening to how children determine the correct places for numbers, you can assess how well they have constructed an understanding of the 1-to-100 sequence and whether they recognize and purposefully use patterns in our number system to recreate the hundreds chart.</p>

<p>Begin with a blank or nearly <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM2_Blank_Hundreds_Chart.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Blank Hundreds Chart</strong></a> (see Blackline Master 2), projecting it on a screen or giving copies to individual children. Then, circle a particular missing number. Children are to fill in the designated number and its &#8220;neighbors&#8221;&#8212;the numbers to the left, to the right, above, and below. After children become comfortable naming the neighbors of a number, ask what they notice about the neighboring numbers. The numbers to the left and right are one more and one less than the given number. Those above and below are ten less and ten more, respectively. What about those numbers on the diagonal? By discussing these relationships on the chart, children begin to see how the sequence of numbers is related to the numerical relationships.</p>
</aside>
<p>Notice that children will first use the hundreds chart to learn about the patterns in the sequence of numbers. In the following activity, number relationships are made more explicit by including the use of base-ten materials in conjunction with the hundreds chart.</p>

<p>Use any base-ten model for two-digit numbers with which the children are familiar. Either the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM32_Base-Ten_Materials.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Base-Ten Materials</strong></a> (see Blackline Master 32) or the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Little_Ten-Frames_1_and_2.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Little Ten-Frame Cards</strong></a> is recommended. Give children one or more numbers to first make with the models and then find on the hundreds chart. Use groups of two or three numbers either in the same row or the same column. Ask children, &#8220;How are the numbers in the row (or column) alike? How are they different?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then indicate a number on the hundreds chart. Ask children, &#8220;What would you have to change to make it into each of its neighbors (the numbers to the left, to the right, above, and below)?&#8221;</p>
<p>As a first step in moving to larger numbers, continue the hundreds chart to 200 and ask similar questions about these larger numbers. You can eventually extend the chart beyond 200.</p>

<p>Several web-based resources include hundreds charts that allow children to explore patterns. &#8220;Learning about Number Relationships&#8221; is an example (from NCTM&#8217;s Illuminations website) that has a calculator and hundreds chart and allows for a variety of explorations. Children can skip-count by any number and also begin their counts at any number. ABCya&#8217;s Interactive Number Chart (0-99 or 1-100) allows children to find and document patterns by coloring the squares that contain the numbers.<span id="page228" class="pagebreak" title="228"/></p>

<p>Provide children with several sheets of the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM2_Blank_Hundreds_Chart.pdf" class="ulink"><strong>Blank Hundreds Chart</strong></a> (see Blackline Master 2). Assign groups of three or four children the task of creating a 1-to-1000 chart. The chart is made by taping 10 blank hundreds charts together in a long strip. Children should decide how they will divide up the task of filling in the chart, with different children working on different parts of the chart. The thousands chart should be discussed as a class to examine how numbers change as you count from one hundred to the next, what the patterns are within and across each hundred, and so on. Note that all of the earlier hundreds chart activities can be extended to thousands charts.</p>
