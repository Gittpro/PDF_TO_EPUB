<h3 class="title" id="chap11-head3_14">Relationships with Benchmark Numbers</h3>
</header>
<p>One of the most valuable features of both the hundreds chart and the little ten-frame cards is how clearly they illustrate the distance to the next multiple of 10&#8212;the number of spaces to the end of the row on the chart or the number of blank spaces on the ten-frame card. Multiples of 10, 100, and occasionally other special numbers, such as multiples of 25, are referred to as <em>benchmark numbers</em>. Children learn to use this term as they work with informal methods of computation. For example, when finding the difference between 74 and 112, a child might say, &#8220;First I added 6 onto 74 and that equals 80, which is a benchmark number. Then I added 2 tens onto 80 to get to 100 because that&#8217;s another benchmark number.&#8221; Whatever terminology is used, understanding how numbers are related to these special numbers is an important step in children&#8217;s development of number sense and place-value understanding.</p>
<p>In addition to the hundreds chart, the number line is an excellent way to explore these relationships. The next two activities are suggestions for using number lines.

<p>Sketch a long line (or use cash register tape) and label 0 and 100 at opposite ends. Mark a point with a &#8220;?&#8221; that corresponds to your secret number. (Estimate the position the best you can.) Children use estimation to try to identify your secret number. For each estimate, place and label a mark at that number on the line until your secret number is discovered. Have children explain how they are making their estimates. Highlight any use of benchmark numbers in their estimations. As a variation, the endpoints can be different from 0 and 100. For example, try 0 and 1000, 200 and 300, or 500 and 800.<span id="page229" class="pagebreak" title="229"/></p>

<p>Label two points on a number line (not necessarily the ends) with benchmark numbers. Show children different points labeled with letters and ask what numbers they might be and why the children think that. In the example shown here, B and C are less than 100 but probably more than 60. E could be about 180. You can also ask where 75 might be or where 400 is located. About how far apart are A and D? Why do you think D is more than 100? For ELLs and children with disabilities, say as well as write the numbers on a note card, or ask children to both write and say the numbers.</p>

<p>In the next activity children apply some of the same ideas about benchmark numbers that we have been exploring.</p>

<p>Put any three numbers on the board. Use two-digit numbers if those are more appropriate for the children.</p>
<p>With these three numbers as referents, ask questions such as the following, encouraging discussion of all responses:</p>
<figure class="figure lc_img25 fx-lightbox">
<img class="fx-lightbox preventTap" alt="A set of 3 ovals contain numbers, 219, 457 and 364." src="../images/unfig11-06.png"></img>
</figure>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Which two numbers are closest? How do you know?</p></li>
<li><p>Which number is closest to 300? To 250?</p></li>
<li><p>Name a number between 457 and 364.</p></li>
<li><p>Name a multiple of 10 between 219 and 364.</p></li>
<li><p>Name a number that is greater than all of these numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Name an even number that is greater than all these numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>About how far apart are 219 and 500? 219 and 1000?</p></li>
<li><p>If these are &#8220;big numbers,&#8221; what are some small numbers? What are some numbers that are about the same? What are some numbers that make these seem small?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For ELLs, modify this activity by using prompts that are similar to each other (rather than changing the prompts each time, which increases the linguistic demand). ELLs and children with disabilities will also benefit from using a visual, such as a number line, and from writing the numbers rather than just hearing them or saying them.</p>
