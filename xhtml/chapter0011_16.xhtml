            As you can see, there is much more to learning about place value than having children state how many ones,
            tens, or hundreds are in a number. Children need ample time and opportunity to fully understand place value
            because it is a complex concept&#8212;so complex that it took humans centuries to develop. Recognizing this
            complexity, an effective shift has been to blend instruction on computation and place value. The NCTM
            <em>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</em> suggest, &#8220;It is not necessary to wait for
            students to fully develop place-value understandings before giving them opportunities to solve problems with
            two- and three-digit numbers. When such problems arise in interesting contexts, students can often invent
            ways to solve them that incorporate and deepen their understanding of place value, especially when students
            have the opportunities to discuss and explain their invented strategies and approaches&#8221; (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_354" >National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,

            context for learning place-value concepts (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_359"
                >Wright et al., 2008</a>). We know that children who only understand
            computation as a digit-oriented exercise and not with full understanding of the numbers involved make many
            errors and have little judgment of the reasonableness of their answers. <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0012_00.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> focuses on helping children build f lexible computational
            strategies using place-value knowledge. Here, in this section, we lay the groundwork for developing both
            conceptual and procedural knowledge as we connect place value to addition and subtraction.</p>

            <p>As you consider the activities in this section, you will find that although you are adding and
                subtracting multidigit numbers, the activities are structured so that you will not be regrouping or
                trading. If you find yourself using a standard procedure, do the activity again using decomposition
                (taking apart numbers) and composition (putting together numbers) rather than regrouping.</p>

        <p>The key purpose of the following activities is to provide opportunities for children to apply their emerging
            understanding of place value to computation using benchmark numbers.</p>

            <p>Say or write a number between 50 and 100. Children respond with &#8220;50 and _______.&#8221; For 63, the
                response is &#8220;50 and 13.&#8221; Any benchmark number can be used instead of 50. For example, you
                could use any number that ends in 50 for the first part (e.g., 450 and some more). Or you could use
                numbers such as 70 or 230 as starting points.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>The benchmark numbers we discussed in our discussions of place value are also used in computational
            strategies to make the calculations easier. The next activity is aimed at what may be one of the most
            important benchmark numbers: 100.</p>

        <p>If your children are adept at finding parts of 100, you can change the whole from 100 to other multiples of

            <p>Suppose that the whole is 83. Sketch four little ten-frame cards showing 36. Looking at your
                &#8220;cards,&#8221; what goes with 36 to make 83? How did you think about it?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>What you might have done in finding the other part of 83 was added up from 36 to 83. Or you might have
            subtracted 33 from 83, which equals 50 and then subtracted 3 more. Either way, notice that you did not
            regroup. Most likely you did it in your head, possibly using benchmark numbers and place value. With more
            practice you (and children as early as the second grade) can do this without the aid of the cards.</p>
        <p>Compatible numbers for addition and subtraction are numbers that easily combine to make benchmark numbers.
            Numbers that make tens or hundreds are the most common examples. Compatible sums also include numbers that
            end in 5, 25, 50, or 75, because these numbers are easy to work with as well. Your task is to get children
            accustomed to looking for combinations that work together and then looking for these combinations in
            computational situations.</p>

            <p>You can differentiate this activity by adjusting the numbers. You may want to begin with a starting
                number that is less than 10 (e.g., 6) for children with disabilities or with a larger number, such as 98
                or 327, for children who need a challenge. Also, the constant addend (<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math232.png" alttext="plus 10" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="33" class="informalequation">
<mo>+</mo><mn>10</mn></math> in the preceding example)
                can be changed to any number with one, two, or three digits. Some children will even find jumps of 5 to
                be challenging if the starting number is not a multiple of 5. Skip counting by 20 or 25 will be easier
                than counting by 7 or 12 and will help develop important patterns and relationships.</p>
            <p>You can also go in reverse. That is, enter a number such as 53 (or 123) in the calculator and press <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math232_1.png" alttext="negative 10" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="33" class="informalequation">

                (or for more of a challenge, try <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math232_2.png" alttext="negative 6" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="33" class="informalequation">
<mo>-</mo><mn>6</mn></math>). As before, children say the result before pressing =. Each
                successive press will subtract 10 or whatever constant was entered. Have children share strategies for
                determining the sum or difference and discuss patterns that appear.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>You can also use a calculator, as in the following activity, to challenge children to determine how much to

                &#8220;0.&#8221; Have them write down the number and operation they think will work. For example, they
                could subtract 80 from 384 to equal 304 (they would write <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math232_4.png" alttext="negative 80" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="33" class="informalequation">

                404 (they would write <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math232_3.png" alttext="plus 20" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="33" class="informalequation">
<mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn></math>). Once they have written down their plan, they enter it into their calculator
                to check to see if the target digit is wiped out. If their plan does not work, they try again. This
                activity may at first seem too easy for your children, but it will surprise you to see how many think
                they need to subtract 8 (instead of 80) or add 2 (instead of 20). Once children catch on, you can
                challenge them with larger numbers and more digits to &#8220;wipe out.&#8221; For example, to increase
                the challenge, have children start with 5,689 and their goal is to &#8220;wipe out&#8221; the

        <p>The hundreds chart can be thought of as a stacked number line&#8212;one that highlights the distance from any
            number to the next multiple of 10. A jump down a row is the same as adding 10, and a jump up a row is 10
            less. To begin, pose problems with relatively small second numbers such as the following:</p>

        <p>Many children will initially count on by ones from the first number, which is an indication that they may not
            understand how to count by tens from any starting value (an important place-value concept). A child who is
            using ten as a unit might explain for the problem <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math234_1.png" alttext="17 plus 14" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="57" class="informalequation">

            added 10 by jumping down a row to 27, and then added 3 more by counting over to 30, and then one more to 31.
            Alternatively, a child might add <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math234_1.png" alttext="17 plus 14" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="57" class="informalequation">

            then moving over 7 spaces to 27, and then counting 4 more spaces to 31.</p>
        <p>The following activity is similar to &#8220;Hundreds Chart Addition&#8221; but explores the idea of adding up

        </aside>
        <p><span id="page235" class="pagebreak" title="235" />In &#8220;How Much Between?&#8221; the choice of the two
            numbers has an impact on the strategies children will use. The easiest pairs are ones in the same column on
            the hundreds chart (e.g., 26 and 76), which is a good place to begin. When the larger number is in a
            different column from the smaller number (e.g., 24 and 76), children can add on tens to get to the target
            number&#8217;s row and then add or subtract ones. Of course, this is also a reasonable strategy for any two
            numbers. But consider 26 and 72, where the column of 72 is to the left of the column that 26 is in. A child
            might count by tens from 26 and go down 4 rows <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math235_01.png" alttext="plus 40" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mo>+</mo><mn>40</mn></math> to get to 66 (the row before 72) and then count by
            ones to get to 72. Or a child might count by tens from 26 and go down 5 rows <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math235_02.png" alttext="plus 50" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mo>+</mo><mn>50</mn></math> to get to 76 and then
            count back by ones to get to 72. There are also other possible approaches, which make the discussion of
            strategies again so important.</p>
        <p>You may be so accustomed to thinking about addition and subtraction computation as involving
            &#8220;regrouping&#8221;&#8212;the trading of 10 ones for a ten or vice versa&#8212;that you tend to believe
            that regrouping is an integral part of computation. In fact, as you will see in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0012_00.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, virtually all invented or alternative strategies for
            computation as well as mental strategies involve no regrouping at all. Rather, what happens in most cases
            might be called &#8220;bridging a ten.&#8221; The row structure of the hundreds chart is especially useful
            in developing this understanding of bridging across ten. Children should have ample opportunities to develop
            their ideas in activities like the ones in this section. Many children are likely still developing their
            ideas about numbers and distances between them. These ideas are as much about place-value understanding as
            about addition and subtraction.</p>

            <p>Children who exhibit difficulty with any of these activities may be challenged with invented computation
                strategies. Therefore, conduct a diagnostic interview to determine how they are reasoning in activities,
                such as <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_16.xhtml#ch11-Activity-11-24">Activity 11.24</a>,
                &#8220;Numbers, Squares, Lines, and Dots.&#8221; That activity requires that children have sufficient
                understanding of base-ten concepts to use them in meaningful counts. If children are counting by ones,
                then more practice with activities like &#8220;Numbers, Squares, Lines, and Dots&#8221; may be
                ineffective. Rather, consider additional counting activities in which children have opportunities to see
                the value of grouping by ten. Using the little ten-frames can help highlight grouping in tens.</p>
