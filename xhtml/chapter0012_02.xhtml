<h2 class="title">Connecting Addition and Subtraction to Place Value</h2>
</header>
<p>One important shift has been to blend instruction on numeration and place value with computation with two- and three-digit numbers (and beyond). Research suggests that problems involving addition and subtraction are a good context for learning place-value concepts (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_363" >Carpenter, Franke, Jacobs, Fennema, &amp; Empson, 1998</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_365" >Cobb &amp; Merkel, 1989</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_372" >Kamii, 1985</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_378" >Madell, 1985</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_374" >Kamii &amp; Joseph, 1988</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_388" >Wright, Martland, Stafford, &amp; Stanger, 2008</a>). If children only understand computation as a digit-by-digit exercise and not based on the value of the numbers involved, they make many errors and are often unable to judge the reasonableness of their answers. In <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_00.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> in the section called &#8220;Connecting Place Value to Addition and Subtraction,&#8221; we emphasized the connection between place value, addition, and subtraction. The key purpose of the activities in that section is to offer children opportunities to apply their emerging understanding of place value to computation using benchmark numbers. Remember, place value is not only a basis for computation; children also develop place-value understanding as a result of finding their own methods for adding and subtracting multidigit numbers.</p>
<p><span id="page240" class="pagebreak" title="240"/>Consider Jerrika, in January of the first grade, who solves a story problem for <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math235_01.png" alttext="10 plus 13 plus 22" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>13</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>22</mn></math> using connecting cubes. Her written work (<a class="xref" href="chapter0012_02.xhtml#fig_12-1">Figure 12.1</a>) shows she is still at a pre&#8211;place-value stage (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_00.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). We can observe that she is beginning to use the idea of &#8220;1 ten&#8221; but most likely counted on the remaining 35 cubes by ones. Her classmate, Monica, solved the same problem but has clearly utilized more base-ten ideas (<a class="xref" href="chapter0012_02.xhtml#fig_12-1">Figure 12.1</a>). Ideas such as these continue to grow with further problem solving and sharing of ideas during class discussions.</p>

<p>The problem given is as follows. Jessica had 10 beads. Monica had 13 beads. Amy had 22 beads. How many beads do they have altogether? The first student, Jerrika, writes I put 1 ten and 35 ones, drew a rod of ten and 35 squares with number sentence, 10 plus 35 = 45 below. The second student, Monica, writes I get 4 tens and 5 ones, and drew 4 rods of 10, labeled, 10, 20, 30 and 40 and five squares labeled 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45. Monica also has a two column chart with one side T for tens and the other, O for ones with the values, 1, 1, 2 in the T column and 0, 3, 2 in the O column with resulting values of 45.</p>

<p><a class="xref" href="chapter0011_00.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> contains several activities that are designed to further children&#8217;s understanding of place value concepts while engaging them in addition and subtraction. The next activity continues with this goal by using little ten-frame cards instead of the hundreds chart you see in many of the activities in <a class="xref" href="chapter0011_00.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: 2.NBT.B.5</strong></p>
<p>Provide pairs of children with two sets of <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Little_Ten-Frames_1_and_2.pdf" class="ulink">Little Ten-Frames</a>. Each child chooses a number and represents it with the little ten-frames. An example <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math235_01.png" alttext="open parentheses 47 plus 36 close parentheses" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mo>(</mo><mn>47</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>36</mn><mo>)</mo></math> is shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_02.xhtml#fig_12-2">Figure 12.2</a>. Partners work to find the total number of dots, recording the pair of numbers and the sum. The activity can also be done by showing the two sets of ten-frames on the projector for 10&#8211;15 seconds and asking the children to give the total. Show them a second time if children request another look.</p>
