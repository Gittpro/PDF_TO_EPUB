</header>
<p><a class="xref" href="chapter0012_03.xhtml#fig_12-3">Figure 12.3</a> lists a general instructional sequence that includes three types of computational strategies. The direct modeling methods can, with guidance, develop into an assortment of more flexible and useful invented strategies, many of which can be carried out mentally. The standard algorithms remain an important part of what children need to learn; however, reinforce that, like the other strategies, the standard algorithms are more useful in some instances than in others. Make sure to discuss which methods seem best in which situations.</p>

<p>In the instructional sequence for 3 types of computational strategies is a set of 3 rectangles, the top rectangle, direct modeling, contains, counts by one with a down arrow to, use of base ten models. An arrow points down to the second rectangle, invented strategies. The rectangle contains, supported by written recordings, and a downward arrow to mental methods when appropriate. An arrow points down to the third rectangle, standard algorithms. the rectangle contains, usually require guided development. Use base ten materials to model the steps. Prove the algorithm produces the correct answer. Should be considered just another strategy that is more useful in some instances.</p>

<h3 id="chap12-head3_1" class="title">Direct Modeling</h3>
</header>
<p>The developmental step that usually precedes invented strategies for addition and subtraction is called <em>direct modeling</em>. This involves the use of manipulatives, drawings, or fingers along with counting to directly represent the numbers involved and the meaning of an operation or story problem. <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_03.xhtml#fig_12-4">Figure 12.4</a> shows an example of direct modeling in which a child has modeled the numbers in the problem using counters and then counted by ones to find the answer.</p>

<p>A possible direct modeling solution for a story problem. The problem is as follows. Savannah had 6 pencils and her mom gave her 5 more. How many pencils does savannah have now? The child counts out 6 tiles, a 2 by 3 array of tiles. The child counts out 5 tiles, a 3 over 2 arrangement of tiles. Then the child counts all tiles to get the answer, 11.</p>

<p>Children who consistently count by ones in additive situations most likely have not developed base-ten grouping concepts. That does not mean that you should avoid giving them problems involving two-digit numbers. Rather, as you work with children who are still struggling to see ten as a unit, suggest that they use a tool to help them think, such as placing counters into ten-frames or making bars of 10 from connecting cubes as they count. Some children will initially use the base-ten rod of 10 as a counting device to keep track of counts of 10, even though they are counting each 10 rod by ones. As children complete each intermediate count, have children write down the corresponding numbers for memory support.</p>
<p>When children have constructed the idea of ten as a unit, they begin to use this idea to move from direct modeling to invented strategies built from number sense and the properties of operations. But it is important to note that direct modeling is a necessary phase for children to work through. Do not push children to <span id="page242" class="pagebreak" title="242"/>prematurely abandon concrete approaches using materials&#8212;including their fingers! However, some children may need encouragement to move away from direct modeling. Here are some ideas to promote the fading of direct modeling:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Record children&#8217;s verbal explanations on the board in ways that they and others can follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask children who have just solved a problem with concrete materials if they can do a similar problem mentally.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask children to make a written numeric record of how they solved the problem with concrete materials. Then have them try the same written method on a new problem.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Accepting direct modeling as a necessary developmental phase provides children who are not ready for more efficient methods a way to explore the same problems as classmates who have progressed beyond this stage.</p>
