        </header>
        <p>More than a century of tradition combined with pressures from families who were taught only the standard
            algorithm may result in thinking that there is only one best approach and one &#8220;right&#8221; algorithm.
            Arguments for a single algorithm generally revolve around efficiency and the need for methods that work with
            all numbers. For addition and subtraction, however, well-understood and practiced invented strategies are
            more than adequate, sometimes more efficient, and often more accurate. And, as already mentioned, they have
            the added bonus of building place-value understanding and number sense.</p>
        <p>The main focus in teaching the standard algorithm should be making sense of the procedure as a process and
            not learning a memorized series of steps. The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" >CCSSO, 2010</a>) require that children
            eventually have knowledge of the standard algorithms (addition and subtraction with multidigit whole numbers
            in grade 4, multiplication with multidigit whole numbers in grade 5, and division of multidigit whole
            numbers in grade 6). Notice that the grades in which this knowledge of standard algorithms is required is
            long after the time where the topic is introduced. This timeline points to the need for full conceptual
            development to take place first. Importantly, the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> recognize that
            teaching only the standard algorithm doesn&#8217;t allow children to explore other useful approaches.
            Understanding how standard algorithms work and when they are the best choice (over an invented approach) is
            central to development of procedural proficiency.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 id="chap-head4_" class="title">Standard Algorithms Must Be Understood</h4>
        </header>
        <p><span id="page245" class="pagebreak" title="245" />Children may pick up the standard algorithms from older
            siblings and family members while you are still trying to teach a variety of invented strategies. Some
            children who already know the standard algorithm may resist learning more flexible strategies, thinking they
            already know the &#8220;right&#8221; approach. What do you do then?</p>
        <p>First and foremost, apply the same rule to standard algorithms as to all strategies: <em>If you use it, you
                must understand why it works and be able to explain it.</em> In an atmosphere that says,
            &#8220;Let&#8217;s figure out why this works,&#8221; children can profit from making sense of standard
            algorithms just as they can with invented strategies. But the responsibility for the explanations should be
            theirs, not yours. Remember, &#8220;Never say anything a kid can say!&#8221; (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_383" >Reinhart, 2000</a>).</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Delay Teaching Standard Algorithms</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Children are unlikely to invent the standard algorithms because methods that begin with the smaller numbers
            (the ones) are not as intuitive. Therefore, you will need to introduce and explain each algorithm and help
            children understand how and why they work. No matter how carefully you introduce these algorithms as simply
            another alternative, children may sense that &#8220;this is the real way&#8221; or the &#8220;one right
            way&#8221; to compute. So spend a significant amount of time with invented strategies&#8212;months, not
            weeks. Do not feel that you must rush to the standard algorithms. Delay! Again, note that the <em>Common
                Core State Standards</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" >CCSSO,
                2010</a>) require that children learn a variety of strategies based on place value and properties of the
            operations one to two years before the standard algorithms are expected to be mastered. The understandings
            children gain from working with invented strategies will make it much easier for you to teach the standard
            algorithms when the time comes. If you think you are wasting precious time by delaying, just be reminded of
            how many years you and others teach the same standard algorithms over and over to children who still make
            errors with them and are still unable to explain them. Here is a video of <a
                    href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/0155_iPad" class="ulink">Gretchen</a> who
            uses the standard algorithm incorrectly but still thinks that answer is correct&#8212;even when other
            approaches lead to a different answer.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Continue to Value All Methods</h4>
        </header>
        <p>The standard algorithm (once it is understood) is one more strategy children can put in their &#8220;toolbox
            of methods.&#8221; Reinforce the idea that just like the other strategies, it may be more useful in some
            instances than in others. Pose problems in which an invented or mental strategy is more useful, such as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>504</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>498</mn></math> or <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math235_01.png" alttext="61 plus 19" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mn>61</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>19</mn></math>. Discuss whether an invented or mental strategy or the standard algorithm seems best.
            Point out that for a problem such as <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math245_02.png" alttext="568 plus 347" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mn>568</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>347</mn></math>, the standard algorithm has advantages.

            <h4 class="title">Cultural Differences in Algorithms</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Some people falsely assume that mathematics is easier than other subjects for children who are not native
            English speakers. However, the reality is that there are many international differences in notation,
            conventions, and algorithms. Knowing more about the diverse algorithms children might bring to the classroom
            and their ways of recording symbols for &#8220;doing mathematics&#8221; will assist you in supporting these
            children and responding to their families. It is important to realize that an algorithm we call
            &#8220;standard&#8221; may not be customary in other countries. So encouraging a variety of algorithms is
            important in valuing the experiences of all children.</p>
        <p><span id="page246" class="pagebreak" title="246" />For example, equal additions is a subtraction algorithm
            used in many Latin and European countries. It is based on the knowledge that adding (or subtracting) the
            same amount to both the minuend and the subtrahend will not change the difference (answer). Therefore, if
            the problem to solve is 25 &#x02212; 15, there is no change to the answer (or the difference) if you subtract
            10 from the minuend and subtrahend and solve 15 &#x02212; 5. There is still a difference of 10. Consider the
            problem 62 &#x02212; 27. Using the algorithm you may think of as &#8220;standard,&#8221; you would likely
            regroup by crossing out the 6 tens, adding the 10 with a small &#8220;1&#8221; to the 2 in the ones column
            (making 12 ones), and then subtract 7 from the 12, and so forth. In the &#8220;equal additions&#8221;
            approach (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_05.xhtml#fig_12-5a">Figure 12.5(a)</a>), you add 10 to the
            ones place (2) in 62 to get 12 ones. You would then counteract that addition of 10 to the minuend by adding
            10 to the 27 (subtrahend), making 37. Now you subtract the 37. Alternatively, a child, using a strategy
            based on equal additions (also called &#8220;same difference&#8221;) (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_371"
                >Humphreys &amp; Parker, 2015</a>) might
            add 3 to both 62 and 27, which results in 65 &#x02212; 30, a much easier problem to solve (<a class="xref"
                href="chapter0012_05.xhtml#fig_12-5b">Figure 12.5(b)</a>). Both of these may sound confusing to you, but
            try them. Especially when there are zeros in the minuend (e.g., 302 &#x02212; 178), you may find this a
            productive option over our &#8220;standard&#8221; algorithm. More important, your possible confusion can
            give you a sense of how your children (and their families) may react to a completely different procedure
            from the one they know and find successful. This <strong>video</strong> (<a

            <p>The equal additions algorithm for the problem, 62 minus 27 equals 35 shown vertically has the 2 in 62,
                crossed out with a 12 above and the 2 in 27 crossed out with a 3 above it. On the side is written, 7 is
                larger than 2 so add 10 ones to the 2 in 62 and 1 ten to the 2 in 27, 12 minus 7 = 5, 6 tens minus 3
                tens = 3 tens.</p>

        <p>Why does the equal additions method result in the same answer? Using an open number line, mark the two
            numbers in the original subtraction problem, such as 302 and 178 in 302 &#x02212; 178. Note the difference or
            the distance between the two numbers (124). Now, using equal additions, change the numbers to create an
            easier problem to subtract. Note the difference or distance between the two numbers in this new problem is
            the same as in the original problem. Adding (or subtracting) the same amount from the minuend and the
            subtrahend just shifts the numbers the same distance along the number line but maintains the difference or
            distance <em>between</em> the two numbers.</p>
        <p>Another key component to understanding cultural differences in algorithms is the emphasis on mental
            mathematics in other countries (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_382" >Perkins &amp;
                Flores, 2002</a>). In fact, some children pride themselves on their ability to do math mentally.
            Don&#8217;t be surprised if children from other countries can produce answers without written work.</p>
