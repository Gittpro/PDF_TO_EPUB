        </header>
        <p>There are three common types of invented strategies to solve addition and subtraction situations that can be
            extended to larger numbers: <strong>split strategy</strong> (<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjRiQpMMI-k"
                    class="ulink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjRiQpMMI-k</a>) (also called
            <em>decomposition</em>), <strong>jump strategy</strong> (<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9haFFL-AMs"
                    class="ulink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9haFFL-AMs</a>) (similar to counting on or
            counting back), and <strong>shortcut strategy</strong> (<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v9Kb-qFVxY"
                    class="ulink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v9Kb-qFVxY</a>) (sometimes known as
            <em>compensation</em>) (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_386" >Torbeyns, De Smedt,
                Ghesquiere, &amp; Verschaffel, 2009</a>). The notion of &#8220;splitting&#8221; a number into parts
            (often by place value) is a useful strategy for all operations. Both the word <em>split</em> and the use of
            a visual diagram help children develop strategies (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_387"
                >Verschaffel et al., 2007</a>). When recording children&#8217;s ideas, try
            using arrows or lines to explicitly indicate how two computations are joined together, as shown in <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0012_07.xhtml#fig_12-6">Figure 12.6(a)</a>.<span id="page248"

            <p>Problem ay: how much is 86 and 47? An exchange with S for the student and T for the teacher follows. S: I
                know that 80 and 20 more is 100. T: Where do the 80 and the 20 come from? S: I split the 47 into 20 and
                20 and 7 and the 86 into 80 and 6. T: illustrates the splitting with 3 lines extending down from 47 to
                20, 20 and 7 and 2 lines extending down from 86 to 80 and 6. T: So then you added one of the 20s to 80?
                S: Yes, 80 and 20 is 100. Then I added the other 20 and got 120. T: writes the equations 80 plus 20 =
                100 and 100 plus 20 = 120 on the board. S: Then I added the 6 and the 7 and got 13. T: writes the
                equation 6 plus 7 = 13. S: Then I added the 120 to the 13 and got 133. T: Indicates with lines that
                extend from 120 and 13 to meet at 133. Problem b: what is 84 minus 68? S: I started at 84. First, I
                jumped back 4 to get to 80. T: draws an open number line with 84 and a hop left, labeled 4 to 80. T: Why
                did you subtract 4 first? Why not 8? S: It was easier to think about 80 than 84. I will save the other
                part of 8 until later. Then I jumped back 60 to get to 20. T: adds a second jump left, labeled 60 to 20.
                S: Then I jumped back 4. T: Teacher adds a third jump left, labeled 4 to 16. Why 4? S: That was how much
                I still had left over from 68.</p>
        </details>
        <p>The <em>empty number line</em> (also known as the <em>open number line</em>) shown in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0012_07.xhtml#fig_12-6">Figure 12.6(b)</a> is a number line with no prewritten numbers or
            tick marks. Children can use it to support their use of a sequential <em>jump strategy</em> that is very
            effective for thinking about addition and subtraction situations (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_362"
                >Caldwell, Kobett, &amp; Karp, 2014</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_369"
                >Gravemeijer &amp; van Galen, 2003</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_387"
                >Verschaffel et al., 2007</a>). The empty number line is much more flexible
            than the usual number line because it works with any numbers, eliminates the confusion with tick marks and
            the spaces between them, and it can be jotted down anywhere. Also, children are less prone to making
            computational errors when using it (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_369"
                >Gravemeijer &amp; van Galen, 2003</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_376"
                >Klein, Beishuizen, &amp; Treffers, 2002</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_387" >Verschaffel et al., 2007</a>).</p>
        <p>You can introduce the empty number line by using it to model a child&#8217;s thinking for the class. Make
            sure to emphasize that the number line, like a ruler, is a length marked off into particular units&#8212;and
            in the case with the open number line, children create their own units with jumps. Children have to
            determine the range of numbers to use on the empty number line based on the problems they are solving. They
            often use &#8220;friendly numbers&#8221; for the jumps or jump to benchmark numbers on the number line and
            then calculate the total of the jumps (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_360"
                >Barker, 2009</a>). The jumps on the number line can be recorded as children
            share or explain each step of their solution, counting up or down from an initial number. With time and
            practice, children find the empty number line to be an effective tool to support and explain their
            reasoning.</p>

        <p>Bar diagrams can also be used to support children&#8217;s thinking and help them explain their ideas to
            others. Bar diagrams work particularly well for contexts that fit a comparison situation and a
            part-part-whole model. See <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_07.xhtml#fig_12-7">Figure 12.7</a> for a sample

            <p>Problem: Ty has read 17 books since the first day of school. His goal is to read 43. How many more books
                does Ty have to read? A rectangle is divided horizontally with one side labeled 43 and the other part
                divided vertically with a part labeled 17 and the other part removed and replaced with a double ended
                arrow and a question mark, to indicate an unknown amount. Second problem: Lizzy had 117 pistachios. She
                ate 32 of them. How many pistachios are left? A rectangle is divided vertically into 2 parts, with one
                part, 32, the other part unknown and the whole rectangle end to end, 117.</p>

            <p>You will find a few interactive number lines on the internet where children can practice using a jump
                strategy to find the distance between two numbers. One of these can be found by searching for &#8220;ICT
                games number line jump.&#8221; With this version you can change where the number line starts ( <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_01.png" alttext="minus 100" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mo>-</mo><mn>100</mn></math> to 200), the number of spaces on the number line (26 spaces versus 66 spaces), and the size of the
                jumps. Another version can be found by searching for &#8220;dreambox number line jumps&#8221; and is
                limited to jumps of size ten.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>The <em>shortcut strategy</em> involves the flexible adjustment of numbers. Just as children used 10 as a
            benchmark number in learning their basic facts, they can move from numbers such as 38 or 69 to the nearest
            10 (in this case 40 or 70) and then later take the 2
            or 1 off to compensate. For example, if we are adding <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_02.png" alttext="38 plus 69" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>38</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>+</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>69</mn></math>, we can adjust these numbers to <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_03.png" alttext="40 plus 70" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>40</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>+</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>70</mn></math>&#8212;which equals 110&#8212;and then take off the three extras to get 107. As another example, <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_04.png" alttext="51 minus 37" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>51</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>-</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>37</mn></math> can be thought of as <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_05.png" alttext="51 plus 6" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="47px" class="informalequation"><mn>51</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>+</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>6</mn></math> to get 57 and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_06.png" alttext="57 minus 37 equals 20" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="94px" class="informalequation"><mn>57</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>37</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>20</mn><mo>;</mo></math> then subtract 6 (because you added
            6 to the start amount to make the problem easier) to get 14. So <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_07.png" alttext="51 minus 37 equals 14" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="94px" class="informalequation"><mn>51</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>37</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>14</mn></math>. Alternatively, you can
            adjust the 37 to 41 and subtract <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_08.png" alttext="51 minus 41" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>51</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>41</mn></math>, which equals 10. Because you subtracted 4 more than you
            needed to (by changing 37 to 41), you need to add 4 back: <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math249_09.png" alttext="10 plus 4" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="47px" class="informalequation"><mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn></math> is 14.</p>
        <p>As these examples suggest, the numbers involved in a problem as well as the type of problem will inf luence
            the strategies children use. Therefore, it is important to think carefully about the type of story problem
            you pose as well as the numbers you use!</p>
