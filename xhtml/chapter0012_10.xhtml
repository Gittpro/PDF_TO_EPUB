        </header>
        <p>Children who know the <em>think-addition</em> strategy for their basic facts can also use this strategy to
            solve problems with multidigit numbers. This is an amazingly powerful way to subtract and is particularly
            successful with children with disabilities (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_381"
                >Peltenburg, van den Heuvel-Panhuizen, &amp; Robitzsch, 2012</a>). <span
                id="page254" class="pagebreak" title="254" />For example, for 45 &#x02212; 29, the idea is to think,
            &#8220;How much do I add to 29 to get to 45?&#8221; Notice that this strategy is not as efficient for 45
            &#x02212; 6 because of the distance between the two numbers, 45 and 6. Using <em>join with change unknown</em>
            problems or <em>missing-part</em> problems (discussed in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapter
                9</a>) will encourage the use of the think-addition strategy. Here is an example of each.</p>

            <p>Sam had 46 baseball cards. He bought some more cards for his collection. Now he has 73 cards. How many

        <p><a class="xref" href="chapter0012_10.xhtml#fig_12-10">Figure 12.10</a> shows invented strategies that use
            addition to solve &#8220;subtraction&#8221; story problems. As you can see, using tens is also an important
            part of these strategies. Simply asking for the difference between two numbers may also prompt these
            strategies.</p>

            <p>The given problem is 73 minus 46 for all 3 strategies. The first strategy is, add tens to get close, then
                ones. 46 and 20 is 66. 30 more is too much. Then 4 more is 70 and 3 is 73. That's 20 and 7 or 27. A
                number line has 46, a hop right, 20, to 66, hop right, 4 to 70 and a hop right, 3 to 73. lines extend
                from 20, 4, and 3 to meet at a number, 27. 46 plus 20 = 66, 66 plus 4 = 70, 70 plus 3 = 73, 20 plus 4
                plus 3 = 27. the second strategy is, add teens to overshoot, then come back. 46 and 30 is 76. that's 3
                too much so it's 27. A number line has 46, a hop right, 30 to 76, and a hop left negative 3 to 73. Lines
                extend up from 30 and negative 3 to a number, 27. 46 plus 30 right arrow 76 minus 3 right arrow 73. 20
                minus 3 = 27. The third strategy is, add ones to make a ten, then tens and ones. 46 and 4 is 50. 50 and
                20 is 70 and 3 more is 73. The 4 and 3 is 7 and 20 is 27. A number line has 46, a hop right, 4 to 50, a
                hop right 10 to 60, a hop right 10 to 70, a hop right 3 to 73. 46 plus 4 right arrow 50, 50 plus 20
                right arrow 70, 70 plus 3 right arrow 73, 4 plus 20 plus 3 = 27. Similarly, 46 and 4 is 50. 50 and 23 is
                73. 23 and 4 is 27. a number line has 46, a hop right, 4 to 50, a hop right 23, to 73.</p>

                    class="ulink">Little Ten-Frame</a>. One child uses the cards to make a number less than 50
                while the other child writes a number greater than 50 on a piece of paper, as shown in <a class="xref"
                    href="chapter0012_10.xhtml#fig_12-11">Figure 12.11</a>). For children with disabilities or children
                who need a challenge, you may choose to suggest the size of the second number (e.g., less than 100; less
                than 500). The children work together to find out how much more must be added to the number shown with
                the ten-frame to get to the larger number written on paper and to write a corresponding equation. Once
                an answer is determined, they should demonstrate how their answer combined with the smaller number
                matches the larger number. Over time, you can fade the use of the little-ten frames.</p>

            models. As always, it is important to have children share their strategies during a discussion.</p>
