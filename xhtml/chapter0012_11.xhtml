</header>
<p>Take-away subtraction is considerably more difficult to do mentally. However, take-away strategies are common, probably because many textbooks emphasize take-away as the meaning of subtraction (even though there are other meanings). Four different strategies are shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_11.xhtml#fig_12-12">Figure 12.12</a> for the following story problem.</p>

<p>The given problem is 73 minus 46 for all strategies. The first strategy is take tens from the tens, then subtract ones. 70 minus 40 is 30. Take away 6 more is 24. Now add in the 3 ones right arrow 27. a number line has 70, a left arrow, negative 40 to 30, left hop, negative 6 to 24, hop right, 3 to 27. 70 minus 40 right arrow 30 minus 6. 24 plus 3 right arrow 27. Or 70 minus 40 is 30. I can take those 3 away, but I need to take away 3 more from the 30 to make 27. A number line has 73, left hop, negative 3 to 70, left hop, negative 40 to 30, left hop, negative 3 to 27. 70 minus 40 = 30, 73 minus 3 = 70, 30 minus 3 = 27. The second strategy is take away tens then ones. 73 minus 40 is 33. then take away 6. 3 makes 30 and 3 more is 27. A number line has 73, a hop left negative 450 to 33, hop left, negative 3 to 30, hop left negative 3 to 27. 73 minus 40 right arrow, 33 minus 3 arrow 30 minus 3 right arrow 27. The third strategy is take extra tens, then add back. 73 take away 50 is 23. That's 4 too many. 23 and 4 is 27. A number line has 73, hop left, 50 to 23, hop right plus 4, took 4 extra to 27. The fourth strategy is, add to the whole if necessary. Give 3 to 73 to make 76. 76 take away 46 is 30. Now give 3 back right arrow 27. A  number line has 73, right hop plus 3 to 76, left hop 46 to 30, left hop negative 3 to 27. 73 minus 46, a plus 3 is above the 46, right arrow, 76 minus 46 right arrow 30 arrow negative 3 right arrow 27.</p>

<p>There were 73 children on the playground. The 46 second-graders came inside first. How many children were still on the playground?</p>

<p>The methods that begin by taking tens from tens are reflective of what most children do with base-ten pieces. The other methods leave one of the numbers intact to do the subtraction. When the subtracted number is a multiple of 10 or close to a multiple of 10, take-away subtraction can be an easy method to do mentally. Try 83 &#x02212; 29 in your head by first taking away 30 and adding 1 back. Some children will become confused when they hear a classmate describe this strategy for 83 &#x02212; 29. In particular, they do not understand why you add 1 back. They think because you added 1 to 29 to make it 30, then you should subtract 1 from the answer. Use a story problem with the numbers and let them act it out with <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM32_Base-Ten_Materials.pdf" class="ulink">Base-Ten Materials</a> (Blackline Master 32) so that they can see that when they take away 30, they took 1 too many away and that is why they need to add 1 back.<span id="page256" class="pagebreak" title="256"/></p>

<p>Try computing 82 &#x02212; 57. Use both take-away and &#8220;think addition&#8221; methods. Can you use all of the strategies in <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_10.xhtml#fig_12-10">Figures 12.10</a> and <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_11.xhtml#fig_12-12">12.12</a>?</p>
</aside>
<p>Remember the &#8220;equal additions&#8221; or &#8220;same difference&#8221; strategy (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_371" >Humphreys &amp; Parker, 2015</a>) that was described earlier in this chapter? There are some children who use this strategy as an invented strategy with take-away subtraction. For example, for 32 &#x02212; 17, children might think that 17 is 3 away from 20, so if they add 3 to 17 to equal 20, they need to add 3 to 32 to get 35 (to maintain the difference between the two numbers). Now the problem is 35 &#x02212; 20 or 15. Encourage children to use an empty number line to see why 32 &#x02212; 17 and 35 &#x02212; 20 have equivalent answers.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for many subtraction problems, especially those with three digits, a &#8220;think addition&#8221; approach is significantly easier than a take-away approach. For children who could benefit from a &#8220;think addition&#8221; approach but are not using it, you may want to revisit some simple missing-part activities to encourage that type of thinking.</p>
