        </header>
        <p>As noted earlier, children are not likely to invent the standard algorithms because they are less intuitive,
            so your instruction when teaching these algorithms will need to be more directed. Given that, it is critical
            that you teach the algorithms in a conceptual manner, helping children understand the units of hundreds,
            tens, and ones as they work.</p>
        <p>The standard algorithms require an understanding of <em>regrouping,</em> exchanging 10 in one place-value
            position for 1 in the position to the left&#8212;or the reverse, exchanging 1 for 10 in the position to the
            right. The corresponding terms <em>borrowing</em> and <em>carrying</em> are obsolete and conceptually
            misleading. The word <em>regroup</em> may have little meaning for young children, so start with the term
            <em>trade</em>: Ten ones are <em>traded</em> for a ten. A hundred is <em>traded</em> for 10 tens. Notice
            that none of the invented strategies involves regrouping.</p>

            </header>
            
            <p>Even after you have taught the standard algorithms, it is important to continue to encourage and promote
                the use of invented strategies. Children must learn to choose the method that best fits the numbers in
                the problem.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Remember to emphasize that standard algorithms are a good choice in some situations, just as invented
            strategies are good choices in some situations. The numbers involved are the determining factor. As
            mentioned earlier, take time to discuss when it is more appropriate to use standard algorithms versus
            invented strategies.</p>

        </header>
        <p>When teaching any procedure (algorithm), you need to begin with the concrete. Then make explicit connections
            between the concept (regrouping) and the procedure. Teaching how to record the steps to the procedure comes
            after much work and discussion with concrete materials.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Begin with Models Only</h4>
        </header>
        <p>In the beginning, focus on regrouping without recording the numerical process. Provide children with

                class="pagebreak" title="258" />Have children use the base-ten materials to make one number at the top
            of the mat and a second beneath it as shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_13.xhtml#fig_12-13">Figure
                12.13</a>. If children are still developing base-ten concepts, a groupable model such as counting chips
            in cups or connecting cubes is helpful. Point out this one rule: <em>Begin in the ones column</em>. Then let
            children solve the problem on their own. Allow plenty of time and then have children explain what they did
            and why. Let children display their work on a projector or use interactive white boards to help with their
            explanations. One or two problems in a lesson with lots of discussion are much more productive than a lot of
            problems based on rules children don&#8217;t understand.</p>

            <p>The given problem is 27 plus 54 = blank. A counting map has a group of 2 rods of ten and 7 counters on a
                ten frame, and a group of 5 rods of ten and 4 counters on a ten frame. 2 questions follow: Can a trade
                be made? How can you tell? A second mat has the same counters with three from the second ten frame moved
                to the first ten frame, trade for a 10. A thought bubble has, I filled up 10. there's 11. that's 10 and
                an extra. A third mat has a group of 3 rods of ten and a second group of 5 rods of ten and a single
                counter on a ten frame with the thought bubble, not enough to trade tens. That's 8 tens and a one, 81.

            they model each step of the procedure with the base-ten materials. The first few times you do this, guide
            each step carefully through questioning, as shown in <a class="xref"

            recording the steps. They should reverse roles with each problem.</p>

            <p>Steps to solve an addition problem are shown on counting mats and place value mats, alongside written
                records of the steps and related instructions from the teacher. The first mat has a group of 3 rods and
                6 counters on a ten frame and a group of 4 rods and 8 counters on a ten frame. The paper record shows 3
                + 4 in the tens column, and 6 + 8 in the ones column. Teacher comments, and predicted responses,
                alongside the first step read as follows. How much is in the ones column? 14. Will you need to make a
                trade? Yes. How many tens will you make? 1. How many ones will be left? 4. Good! Make the trade now. The
                second mat, group ones, has a group of 3 rods and 10 counters on a ten frame and a group of 4 rods and 4
                counters on a ten frame. The third mat, trade for a ten, has a group of 3 rods and no counters, and a
                group of 5 rods and 4 counters. The paper solution shows 6 + 8 = 4 in the ones column, and a 1 carried
                over to the tens place. Teacher comments read as follows: Let's stop now and record exactly what we have
                done. You had 14 ones, and you made 1 ten and 4. Write a 1 in the tens column to show the ten you put
                there and a 4 in the answer space of the ones column for the 4 ones left. Look at the tens column on
                your mat. You have 1 ten on top, 3 from the 36, and 4 more from the 48. See how your paper shows the
                same thing? Now add all the tens together. Write how many tens that is in the answer space for the tens
                column. The fourth and final mat has nothing in the upper group, and 8 rods and 4 counters in the lower
                group.The paper solution shows 6 + 8 = 4 in the ones column, with the 1 carried to the tens column, and
                1 + 3 + 4 = 8 in the tens column.</p>
        </details>
        <p>A common error children make is to record their answers in this way:</p>
        <figure class="figure_wrap">
            <img alt="" role="presentation" src="../images/unfig12-04.png"></img>
        </figure>
        <p>As you can see, this child has lost her connection to the place value and is treating the ones and tens as
            two separate problems. The child should try to use another way to check her answer&#8212;in this case,
            suggest having her estimate a reasonable answer and then use manipulatives, such as base-ten blocks, to help
            her model the problem. Cover up her initial answer and ask, &#8220;Do you think your answer will be between
            100 and 200 or 200 and 300?&#8221; to help the child see that an answer in the thousands is not logical.
            Take a look at <a href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/0201_iPad"
                    class="ulink">Talecia</a> as she, too, loses her connection to the real value of the
            numbers she is recording when she adds 638 + 476.</p>
        <p><a class="xref" href="chapter0012_13.xhtml#fig_12-16">Figure 12.16</a> shows a variation of the traditional
            recording scheme that is very effective because it highlights the actual value of the numbers and is
            relatively efficient, at least for up to three digits. This is known as the partial sums approach and avoids
            the &#8220;carried ones.&#8221; If children start adding on the left as they are inclined to do, partial
            sums would just be a vertical recording scheme for the invented strategy &#8220;add tens, add ones, then
            combine&#8221; (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_09.xhtml#fig_12-9">Figure 12.9</a>). This adaptation
            is particularly effective for children with disabilities.</p>
