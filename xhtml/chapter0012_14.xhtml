        </header>
        <p><span id="page259" class="pagebreak" title="259" />The general approach to developing the subtraction
            algorithm is the same as for addition. When the procedure is completely understood with models, a
            do-and-record approach connects it with a written form.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Begin with Models Only</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Start by having children treat the subtraction problem as a &#8220;take-away&#8221; situation. With this
            meaning of subtraction, they model only the first (top) number in a subtraction problem (minuend) on the top
            half of their place-value mats. For the amount to be subtracted, have children write each digit on a small
            piece of paper and place these pieces near the bottom of their mats in the respective columns, as in <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0012_14.xhtml#fig_12-17">Figure 12.17</a>. To avoid errors, suggest making all
            necessary trades first. That way, the full amount on the paper slip can be taken off at once. Also explain
            to children that they are to begin working with the ones column first, as they did with addition.<span

            <p>The problem 45 minus 27 = blank is next to a counting mat with 4 rods and 5 counters in a ten frame with
                a number card 2 below the rods and number card 7 below the counters. Not enough ones to take off 7.
                Trade a ten for 10 ones. The second mat has 5 counters on the top ten frame, 4 rods with one rod circled
                and an arrow extending to the second ten frame which now has ten counters to indicate a trade. Now there
                are 15 ones. I can take 7 off easily. The third mat has 3 rods, 5 counter in the first ten frame and 3
                counters in the second ten frame with arrows extending up to the first ten frame. and now I can take off
                2 tens. it does not matter which ones come off. Put the leftovers together. the fourth mat has a rod and
                8 counter in a ten frame. That's 18 left. 45 minus 27 = 18.</p>

            <p>Virtual base-ten blocks for addition and subtraction are available at the National Library of Virtual
                Manipulatives. These two similar applets use base-ten blocks on a place-value chart. You can form any
                problem you wish up to four digits. The subtraction model shows the bottom number in red instead of
                blue. When the top blocks are dragged onto the red blocks, they disappear. Although you can begin in any
                column, the model forces a regrouping strategy as well as a take-away model for subtraction. These
                digital versions of physical base ten materials are useful for reinforcing the standard algorithm.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Anticipate Difficulties with Zeros</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Problems that include numbers in which zeros are involved tend to cause special difficulties. The common
            errors that emerge when &#8220;regrouping across zero&#8221; are best addressed at the modeling stage. For
            example, in 403 &#x02212; 138, children must make a double trade: trading a hundreds piece for 10 tens and
            then a tens piece for 10 ones. After children have experience with making trades using base-ten materials,
            use the following activity before giving children any hints about how they might deal with regrouping across
            a zero.</p>

            <p>Pose a problem to the class that requires regrouping across zero, such as 103 &#x02212; 78. Children work
                in pairs using <a
                        href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM32_Base-Ten_Materials.pdf"

                        class="ulink">Place-Value Mats</a> (Blackline Master 17). Once they have identified an
                answer, they now check their answer using an invented strategy. If they did not get the same answer with
                the base-ten materials and their invented strategy, encourage them to try to determine why. Follow up
                with a discussion that starts with children sharing their ideas.<span id="page261" class="pagebreak"

            <h4 class="title">Develop the Written Record</h4>
        </header>
        <p>The process of recording each step as it is done is the same as was suggested for addition using the
            <a
                    href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM20_Addition_and_Subtraction_Recording_Sheets.pdf"
                    class="ulink">Addition and Subtraction Recording Sheets</a> (Blackline Master 20). When
            children can explain the use of the symbols involved in the recording process, fade the use of physical
            materials and move to the complete use of symbols. Again, be attentive to problems with zeros.</p>
        <p>If children are permitted to follow their natural instincts and begin with the biggest pieces (from the left
            instead of the right), recording schemes similar to that shown in <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0012_14.xhtml#fig_12-18">Figure 12.18</a> are possible. The trades are made from the pieces
            remaining <em>after</em> the subtraction in the column to the left has been done. The &#8220;regroup across
            zero&#8221; difficulty will still occur in problems like 462 &#x02212; 168 when working left to right. Try it.

            <p>Contrast teaching children to regroup in subtraction, especially regrouping across zero, with
                think-addition. For example, try solving this: 428 and how much equals 703? Now think about teaching
                children to regroup across zero to solve 703 &#x02212; 428. Which is easier? Why?</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Once children understand the standard algorithms for addition and subtraction of multidigit numbers, it is
            important to provide them opportunities to determine which strategy from a variety of strategies might be
            more useful, given the specific numbers involved. The following activity provides this experience.</p>

            <p>Tell children you are going to show them a problem, but they are NOT to solve it&#8212;they are simply to
                decide which method from their invented strategies and standard algorithms they would choose to solve
                the problem and be ready to explain why. Projecting a list of strategies for addition (or subtraction)
                problems will support children with disabilities and English Language Learners by allowing them to focus
                on the task at hand without requiring them to rely on remembering the names of strategies. After
                children have made their choice, call out each method and have them raise their hand to indicate which
                method they have selected. Then children are to use their selected method to solve the given problem.
                Once finished, they are to raise their thumb and hold it to their chest. Have children share solutions
                for each different method. Then ask which method seemed to work best for each problem and why. Make sure
                to use a variety of problems whose numbers lend themselves to different strategies.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Helping children develop flexible methods of adding and subtracting strengthens their understanding of place
            value, number relationships, and operations. Comparing methods used, including the standard algorithms,
            supports children in better understanding these methods, which results in their making fewer computational
            errors. An assortment of computational strategies will serve children well on assessments, in later grades,
            and in life.</p>
