<h3 id="chap12-head3_14" class="title">Suggestions for Teaching Computational Estimation</h3>
</header>
<p>Here are some general principles that are worth keeping in mind as you help your children develop computational estimation skills.</p>
<header>
<h4 class="title">Use Real Examples</h4>
</header>
<p>Discuss real-life situations in which computational estimations are used. Some common examples include adding up the cost of several items in a store to make sure you have enough money; determining approximate weekly totals (milk cartons purchased in the school cafeteria, school supplies used in class, time playing games on a tablet or smartphone); and determining the lengths of several objects together (tables in cafeteria, desks in classroom, class pets, children&#8217;s shoes). Look at newspaper headlines to find where numbers are the result of estimation and where they are the result of precision (e.g., &#8220;Hundreds of Students Leave School Ill&#8221; versus &#8220;Fourteen Local Students Place in Regional Destination Imagination Competition&#8221;). Children are more motivated by real examples&#8212;for example, asking children, &#8220;About how many hours do you spend watching TV in one week? One month? How can you figure it out?&#8221;</p>
<header>
<h4 class="title">Use Estimation Language</h4>
</header>
<p>Words and phrases such as <em>about</em>, <em>close</em>, <em>just about</em>, <em>a little more</em> (or <em>less</em>) <em>than</em>, and <em>between</em> are part of the language of estimation. Children should understand that they are trying to get as close as possible using efficient methods, but there is no &#8220;one correct&#8221; or &#8220;winning&#8221; estimate. Language can help convey that idea.</p>
<header>
<h4 class="title">Use a Context</h4>
</header>
<p>Situations play a role in estimation. For example, is it a reasonable expectation for the cost of a game to be $9 or $90. Could attendance at the school musical be 30 or 300 or 3000? A simple computation can provide the important digits, with knowledge of the context providing the rest.</p>
<header>
<h4 class="title">Accept a Range of Estimates, Offer a Range As an Option</h4>
</header>
<p>Because estimates are based on computation, how can there be different answers? The answer, of course, is that any particular estimate depends on the strategy used and the kinds of adjustments made in the numbers. Estimates also vary with the level of precision needed. Estimating how much time it will take someone to drive to the store is quite different from trying to decide whether your last $5 will cover three items you need at Fast Mart. What estimate would you give for <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math263_01.png" alttext="270 plus 325" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="77px" class="informalequation"><mn>270</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>325</mn></math>? If you use <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math263_02.png" alttext="200 plus 300" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="77px" class="informalequation"><mn>200</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>300</mn></math>, you might say 500. Or you might use 250 for the 270 and 350 for the 325, which is 600. You could also use 300 for 270 and add 325, equaling 625. Is only one of these &#8220;right&#8221;? By sharing children&#8217;s estimates and letting them discuss how and why different estimates emerged, they can begin to see that estimates generally fall in a range around the exact answer.</p>
<p><em>Important teacher note</em>: Do not reward or overemphasize the estimate that is the closest. It is already very difficult for children to handle &#8220;approximate&#8221; answers; worrying about accuracy and pushing for &#8220;the one&#8221; closest answer exacerbates this problem. Instead, focus on whether the answers given are <em>reasonable</em> for the situation or problem at hand. Especially when introducing estimation, it is a good idea to offer ranges for the estimates. Ask whether the answer will be between 300 and 400, 450 and 550, or 600 and 700.</p>
<header>
<h4 class="title">Focus on Flexible Methods, Not Answers</h4>
</header>
<p>Remember that having children reflect on the strategies used by classmates will lead to additional strategy development. Class discussions about estimation are just as important as they <span id="page264" class="pagebreak" title="264"/>were for the development of invented strategies for computation. For any given situation, there are often several very good but different methods of estimation.</p>
<p>Here is an activity in which a specific number is not required to answer the questions that involve addition and subtraction. The amounts used can represent lengths, time, or simply numbers without a context.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch12-Activity-12-10">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch12-Activity-12-10">Activity 12.10 Is It Over or Under?</h2></header>
<figure class="figure_wrap">
<img alt="" role="presentation" src="../images/activity.png"></img>
</figure>
<p><strong>CCSS-M: 2.NBT.B.5; 2.MD.A.3; 2.MD.C.7</strong></p>
<figure class="figure_wrap">

</figure>
<p>Here are some addition/subtraction examples that do not use a context. The children are to use estimation to determine whether the answer would be over or under a target amount.</p>
<p><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math264_01.png" alttext="37 minus 75" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>37</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>7</mn></math> (over/under 100)</p>
<p><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math264_02.png" alttext="712 minus 458" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="77px" class="informalequation"><mn>712</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>458</mn></math> (over/under 300)</p>
<p>You can add an interesting context to make this activity accessible to more learners, but remember that using multiple contexts can be difficult for ELLs, who must learn each new context. Consider playing &#8220;Is It Over or Under?&#8221; several times using one context (e.g., the length of classroom objects) and then varying the values each time. Project the lengths of various objects on a document projector, such as the following. The children are to determine whether the total of the lengths are over or under the target amount of 30 feet. (Note that the target amount need not be the same for each problem.)</p>
<p>Over/Under 30 feet:</p>
<p>Bulletin Board: 6 feet</p>
<p>Table: 3 feet</p>
<p>Shelf: 10 feet</p>
<p>Teacher&#8217;s Desk: 5 feet</p>
<p>You can also use time as a context, having children estimate using the nearest five minutes (<strong>2.MD.C.7).</strong> For example, if the target time is 1 hour, children use time to the nearest five minutes to determine how these amounts relate to 1 hour:</p>
<p>23, 11, 18 minutes, (over/under 1 hour)</p>
<p>5 time slots, 13 minutes each (over/under 1 hour)</p>
