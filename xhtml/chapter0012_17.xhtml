<h2 class="title">Computational Estimation Strategies</h2>
</header>
<p>There are numerous strategies that are helpful in computing estimates in addition and subtraction. Here are a few to present to children.</p>
<header>
<h3 id="chap12-head3_15" class="title">Front-End Methods</h3>
</header>
<p>A front-end approach is reasonable for addition or subtraction when all or most of the numbers have the same number of digits. <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_17.xhtml#fig_12-19">Figure 12.19</a> illustrates this idea. Notice that when a number has fewer digits than the rest, that number may be ignored initially. Also note that only the front (leftmost) number is used and the computation is then done as if there were zeros in the other positions.</p>

<p>Example ay, front end addition, column form, has the following numbers top to bottom to be added together: 489, 37, 51, and 208. The hundreds place column, 4 and 2, are shaded and the tens place column circled and 3 thought bubbles, 4 plus 2 = 6 about 600, adjust about 150 more, about 750. The second example, b, front end addition where numbers are not in columns, has three price tags with the values, 98 dollars, 250 dollars and 625 dollars with 3 thought bubbles underneath. Front end, hundreds place, 0 plus 2 plus 6 = 8, about 800 dollars, adjust ten place, 9 plus 5 plus 2 = 16, 160 to 170 dollars more, about 970 dollars.</p>
</details>
<p>After adding or subtracting the front digits, an adjustment is made to correct for the digits or numbers that were ignored. Making an adjustment is actually a separate skill. Initially, practice just using the front digits. Make sure that children pay close attention <span id="page265" class="pagebreak" title="265"/>to place value and only consider digits in the largest place, especially when the numbers vary in the number of digits. The front-end strategy can be easy to use because it does not require rounding or changing numbers.</p>
