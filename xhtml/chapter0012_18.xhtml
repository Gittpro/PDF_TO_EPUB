<p>Children are not required to use rounding in the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> until third grade, but rounding can help children build number sense and use invented strategies efficiently to find exact sums and differences. If your children are ready, you can use the following activity to introduce them to the concept of rounding. When several numbers are to be added, it is usually a good idea to round them to the same place value. Keep a running sum as you round each number <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_18.xhtml#fig_12-20">Figure 12.20</a> shows an example of rounding.</p>

<p>Create a number line on the floor with painter&#8217;s tape, a rope, or cash register tape. Use sticky notes or pieces of paper to label the benchmark numbers of tens (10, 20, 30, . . . ), hundreds (100, 200, 300, . . . ) or whatever range of numbers you are considering as a class. Have the numbers far apart so that 3 to 4 children can stand facing forward between each number. Then distribute numbers for children to round. For example, give a child the number 53. The child stands on the line where 53 should be, then rounds to the nearest ten (50). Talk about the case of a 5 in the ones position (or in other halfway positions for larger numbers) as a convention&#8212;we all agree that we round up when we are midway between numbers.</p>
</aside>
<p>For addition and subtraction problems involving only two numbers, one strategy is to round only one of the two numbers. For example, you can round only the subtracted number such as 624 &#x02212; 83 becomes 624 &#x02212; 100, resulting in 524. You can stop here, or you can adjust. Adjusting might go like this: Because you subtracted a bigger number, the result must be too small&#8212;by about 20, the difference between 100 and 80. Adjust to about 540.</p>
