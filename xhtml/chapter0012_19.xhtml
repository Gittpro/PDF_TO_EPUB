        <p><span id="page266" class="pagebreak" title="266" />It is sometimes useful to look for two or three compatible
            numbers that can be grouped to equal benchmark values (e.g., 10, 100, 500). If numbers in the list can be
            adjusted slightly to equal these amounts, that will make finding an estimate easier. This approach is
            illustrated in <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_19.xhtml#fig_12-21">Figure 12.21</a>. In subtraction, it is
            often possible to adjust only one number to produce an easily observed difference, as illustrated in <a
                class="xref" href="chapter0012_19.xhtml#fig_12-22">Figure 12.22</a>.</p>

            <p>The first example is a two column list of scout troops, 2000 and the corresponding number of merit badges
                as follows: eagles, 41; explorers, 29; wolf pack, 63; grizzlies, 117; cougars, 65; braves, 48;
                mountaineers, 85. To the side are 3, 100's, each with two arrows extending to 3 sets of badge numbers as
                follows: 41 and 63, 29 and 66, 17 and 85. A thought bubble contains, 3 hundreds, I didn't use the 48,
                about 350. The second example is a menu with the following items and prices: steak, 14 dollars and 10
                cents; lasagna, 11 dollars and 50 cents; shrimp, 8 dollars and 79 cents; Caesar salad, 6 dollars and 15
                cents; pie, 2 dollars and 75 cents; pudding, 2 dollars. A thought bubble contains, 14 and 6 is 20. The 8
                and 11, and change, is another 20, that's 40 and 5 more, about 45 dollars.</p>

            <p>An example of using compatible numbers to find the difference has 2 price tags, a thought bubble. and the
                heading, how much did you save? The first price tag has price, 184 dollars, the second has 184 dollars
                crossed out and a sale price of 128 dollars. The thought bubble contains, change 128 to 124. From 124 to
                184 is 60.</p>

            of mental computation and estimation. Figuring out where the numbers go to create the exact solution
            involves estimation.</p>

                children a set of equations with answers only and ask them to use their number cards (in the squares)
                and operations (in the circle) so that the computation results in the answers shown.</p>

            <p>For children who have disabilities, you may want to have the operation signs already displayed with
                answers (such as an addition or a subtraction sign for the answer 42). These fixed problems will reduce
                the amount of decision making needed and allow children to focus on the numbers.</p>

            <p>To get a sense of a child&#8217;s estimation skills and understanding, in a diagnostic interview, ask the
                child to solve the following: &#8220;Charlie wants to estimate how much he needs to save to buy two
                video games. One game is $99 and the other is $118. How much should he save to purchase the two
                games?&#8221; Ask the child how he came up with his estimate. If the child is trying to mentally carry
                out the standard algorithm in the air or on the table with a finger, he likely has a limited ability
                with estimation strategies. Because $99 is so close to $100, it would be important for the child to use
                that idea in combining the two prices. If the child is unclear whether to change 99 to 100 or to 98 (as
                it is equally as close), that would pinpoint a lack of understanding of the purpose of estimation.
                Estimation cannot be easily assessed with paper-and-pencil tasks, so interviews that require
                explanations give more substantial evidence of a child&#8217;s understanding.</p>
