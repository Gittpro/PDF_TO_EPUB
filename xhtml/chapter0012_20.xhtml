<h2 class="title">Common Misconceptions with Whole-Number Computation</h2>
</header>
<p><a class="xref" href="chapter0012_20.xhtml#tab_12-1">Table 12.1</a> provides a summary of the most common errors and misconceptions children will demonstrate with whole-number computation, along with suggestions about how to help them work through these issues. Notice that many of the misconceptions are related to children&#8217;s use of the standard algorithms, not invented strategies. The reason for this is primarily because a child&#8217;s invented strategies are ones that the child generates using ideas about place value, properties, and operations that make sense to him or her.<span id="page268" class="pagebreak" title="268"/></p>

<p><em>Sarah ate 34 marshmallows. Sarah ate 6 more marshmallows than Rich. How many marshmallows did Rich eat?</em></p>
<p>The child solves the problem by adding 34 and 6 because s/he interprets the word &#8220;more&#8221; to mean &#8220;add.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child is stumped when faced with story problems that have no key words, such as: <br/><em>Laurie has 83 pennies. 16 of them are shiny. The others are dull. How many are dull?</em></p></td>
<td><ul class="bulleted"><li><p>Covering up the number &#8220;6&#8221; in the word problem, ask the child to read the problem. Then ask the child who ate more marshmallows.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the child use bar diagrams to represent the amounts for Sarah and the amounts for Rich to help make more explicit the relationship between the quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not teach key words to solve word problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to pose story problems and contextual problems that include all four problem types (join, separate, part-part-whole, compare) with the unknown quantity in different locations so children gain experience thinking about and solving a variety of situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Have available and encourage the use of physical materials for children to model story/contextual problems. Discuss what they have done to determine the answer.</p></li>
