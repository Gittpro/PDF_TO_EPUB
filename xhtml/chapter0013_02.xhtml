<h2 class="title">Structure in the Number System: Connecting Number and Algebra</h2>
</header>
<p>Algebra is often referred to as generalized algebra. For children to generalize say, an operation, they must consider several examples and identify commonalities that can be used to describe any of the examples&#8212;in other words, they have to go beyond individual examples to make claims about the operation for an entire type of number (e.g., whole numbers, natural numbers, fractions). These generalizations help children gain insights into the structure of the number system. The process of generating generalizations from number and arithmetic begins as early as prekindergarten and continues as children learn about all aspects of number and computation, including basic facts and meanings of the operations. Here we share three ways to connect arithmetic to algebra.</p>

</header>
<p><span id="page272" class="pagebreak" title="272"/>Looking for generalizations in sets of problems can begin in the early grades as young children decompose and compose numbers and use a variety of strategies to add and subtract. Consider the following problem that provides children a chance to think about decomposing numbers while building a sense of what the operation of addition involves:</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_01">
<p>There are 5 frogs in a pond. Some jump onto a lily pad and some jump onto a rock. How many frogs might be on the lily pad and how many might be on the rock?</p>
</aside>
<p>This problem provides children with the opportunity to notice generalizable characteristics, such as increasing the number on the lily pad by one means reducing the number on the rock by one. To facilitate the generalization, children can be challenged to find all the ways the frogs might be on the lily pad and the rock. The significant algebraic question is how to decide when all the solutions have been found. Give children a recording sheet, such as the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Frogs_on_a_Pond_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Frogs on a Pond</a> recording sheet, so it will be easier for they to record their solutions and look for patterns. To begin with, children might reply they cannot think of any different ways to place the frogs. Ask questions to focus children&#8217;s attention on the relationship between adjacent solutions (e.g., <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math272_01.png" alttext="1 plus 4" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="37px" class="informalequation"><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn></math> and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math272_02.png" alttext="2 plus 3" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="37px" class="informalequation"><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></math>) (e.g., &#8220;How are the first numbers, 1 and 2, related; how are the second numbers, 4 and 3, related?&#8221;). As children recognize these relationships, they will begin to strategically use each number from 0 to 5 for the lily pad and the corresponding number for the rock.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch_12_teach02">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch_12_teach02">Teaching Tip</h2></header>

<p>In these kinds of problems, children often do not consider the combinations with zero. If this happens, simply ask, &#8220;Could the lily pad or the rock be empty?&#8221;</p>
</aside>
<p>As shown on the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Frogs_on_a_Pond_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Frogs on a Pond</a> recording sheet, continue to work toward generalization by looking at other quantities of frogs (e.g., how many ways for 7 frogs? for 10 frogs?). Ask children what patterns or consistencies do they notice across these cases. Once they have found all the solutions for each case, ask, &#8220;What do you notice about the number of solutions and the number of frogs?&#8221; When a child is able to explain that for each number 0 to 5 there is one solution, he or she no longer has to partition 5 into parts to find solutions but is making a generalization about how to determine the number of solutions without having to list them. For example, the child might explain, &#8220;There is always one more way than the number of frogs.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>8 Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>This reasoning can be applied to other numbers and in other contexts, which is an important step in generalization. The children&#8217;s book <em>The Sleepover</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_398" >Fosnot, 2007</a>) describes a context with eight children rearranging themselves on a pair of bunk beds. This situation offers another opportunity for children to grapple with the idea of finding all the possible combinations for a given number. And yet another children&#8217;s book, <em>The Double-Decker Bus</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_408" >Liu &amp; Fosnot, 2007</a>), uses a double-decker bus to provide opportunities to think about possible number combinations.</p>
<p>The following activity purposefully focuses children&#8217;s attention on the adjacent combinations in an effort to help them generalize and reason more strategically.</p>

<p>Have children select a number, such as 7, and add it to itself. The task is to find out what happens to the sum if you add 1 to one of the sevens and subtract 1 from the other seven (e.g., <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math272_03.png" alttext="8 plus 6" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="37px" class="informalequation"><mn>8</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn></math>). You can refer to this action as &#8220;one up&#8221; and &#8220;one down&#8221; but be sure English Language Learners know the words &#8220;up&#8221; and &#8220;down&#8221; and how those relate to the action taking place. You can model moving <em>up one space</em> and <em>down one space</em> on a number line.</p>
<p><span id="page273" class="pagebreak" title="273"/>A mathematics balance (a plastic &#8220;number line&#8221; on a fulcrum) can be useful, especially for children with disabilities, to physically model the movement of one hanging weight and the effect it has on the balance of the equation. If you do not have such a balance, use a two-sided mat with an equal sign in the middle to demonstrate making equations that show that what is on the left side of the mat is the same as (or equal to) what is on the right side of the mat. You can also find an interactive version by searching for &#8220;Number Balance&#8221; on the University of Cambridge&#8217;s NRICH website.</p>
<p>To facilitate generalization, ask children, &#8220;Does this &#8220;one up&#8221; and &#8220;one down&#8221; action work with other numbers? Does it only work if you start with a number plus itself? Can you explain why it works? What else can you find out?&#8221; See the corresponding <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/Expanded_Lesson_One_Up_and_One_Down.pdf" class="ulink">Expanded Lesson: One Up and One Down</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Some children may wonder if &#8220;One Up and One Down&#8221; works for &#8220;really big numbers.&#8221; Suggest they test their ideas with a calculator. It is also useful to explore the idea of two up and two down, and so on. Note that the results are the same as long as the same amount is added and subtracted. This exploration can be useful when learning basic facts (<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math273_01.png" alttext="6 plus 8" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="37px" class="informalequation"><mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>8</mn></math> is the same as <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math273_02.png" alttext="7 plus 7" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="37px" class="informalequation"><mn>7</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>7</mn></math> or double 7).</p>

<p><strong>2 Reasoning abstractly and quantitatively.</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>Children may want to know if the one-up/one-down idea works for subtraction. (It does not.) But there is an important pattern to discover: If both numbers change in the same direction, up or down, the result is the same. (This is called &#8220;equal additions&#8221; or &#8220;same difference&#8221; [<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_402" >Humphreys &amp; Parker, 2015</a>] and is described in <a class="xref" href="chapter0005_00.xhtml">Chapters 5</a> and <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_00.xhtml">12</a>.) Recognizing this allows us to change 12&#8211;8 to 10&#8211;6, or 83&#8211;48 to 85&#8211;50, changing potentially difficult problems to easier ones. Pose a story problem like the following example to help children build a sense of what the operation of subtraction involves. Change the problem type to offer opportunities to consider other meanings of subtraction (e.g., comparison, missing part).</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="print_02">
<p>Ben had 16 pretzels. If he ate one pretzel, he&#8217;d have 15 left. What other numbers of pretzels could Ben start with and how many would he have to eat to always have 15 left?</p>
</aside>
<p>Have children generate several subtraction expressions that equal 15. Arrange them in a sequence to increase the likelihood that children will notice that both numbers increase by 1:</p>
<p class="center">
16&#8722;1</p>
<p class="center">
17&#8722;2</p>
<p class="center">
18&#8722;3</p>
<p class="center">
19&#8722;4</p>
<p class="center">
20&#8722;5</p>
<p>Encourage them to describe what is happening across the examples. Children may say something like, &#8220;When the number is smaller, you don&#8217;t have to subtract as much to get 15. But with bigger numbers, you have to subtract more because there are more.&#8221; Or &#8220;As it gets bigger, he has to take away more to equal 15.&#8221; You will need to help children refine their language and explanations as they learn to describe generalizations to ensure they are being explicit. For example, require children to be clear about what they mean by &#8220;it&#8221; and &#8220;this&#8221;&#8212;as seen in the second child&#8217;s explanation&#8212;and look for opportunities to refine language and introduce vocabulary when appropriate (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_419" >Russell, Schifter, &amp; Bastable, 2011</a>). The generalization that the difference is maintained when both numbers are increased (or decreased) by the same amount supports the development of the &#8220;equal additions&#8221; strategy.</p>
