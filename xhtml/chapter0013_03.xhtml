</header>
<p><span id="page274" class="pagebreak" title="274"/>Fundamental to mental mathematics is generalizing place-value concepts. For example, consider how you would do the sum <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math_274_0.png" alttext="49 plus 18" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>49</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>18</mn></math> in your head. Many people, because of their past experiences with similar sums, will move one over from 18 to make a ten and think <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math274_01.png" alttext="50 plus 17" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>50</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>17</mn></math>. Alternatively, they could move two over from 49 to make a ten and think <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math274_02.png" alttext="47 plus 20" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="57px" class="informalequation"><mn>47</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>20</mn></math>. Either way, the idea of changing the numbers so that you are working with a multiple of ten is a powerful strategy based on place-value that is generalized from experiences with previous examples. Many of these strategies and examples have been addressed in the previous four chapters.</p>
<p>The hundreds chart is a useful tool to help children generalize the relationship between tens and ones. Ask children, &#8220;What did we add to get from 72 to 82? From 5 to 15? From 34 to 44?&#8221; Children notice across these examples (and more like them) that they are adding 10 and, on the hundreds chart, moving down exactly one row. Moves on the hundreds chart can be represented with arrows (for example, &#8594; means move right one column or plus 1, and &#8593; means move up one row or subtract 10). Consider asking children to complete these problems:</p>

</aside>
<p>Some children may count up or back using a count-by-ones approach. Others may know to jump 10 or 1 (up or down). Still others may recognize that a downward arrow &#8220;undoes&#8221; an upward arrow&#8212;an indication that these children are moving toward generalizations (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_391" >Blanton, 2008</a>). In other words, they recognize that <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math274_03.png" alttext="plus 10" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mo>+</mo><mn>10</mn></math> and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math274_04.png" alttext="negative 10" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="33px" class="informalequation"><mo>-</mo><mn>10</mn></math> results in zero change.</p>

<p>As children work on tasks like the one just described, you can observe while using a checklist to note which children solve tasks by counting by ones, by jumping, or by noticing the &#8220;doing&#8221; and &#8220;undoing.&#8221; What you observe can help you identify which children&#8217;s approaches to highlight during the subsequent discussion. For example, you can start the discussion by having children who used the more basic strategies (e.g., a count-by-ones approach or a jumping strategy) share and then have children who have generalized the situation share how they think about it.</p>

<p>The next activity provides an engaging context for children to explore patterns involving place value and addition.</p>

<p>Provide children with a copy of a <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM3_Hundreds_Chart.pdf" class="ulink">Hundreds Chart</a> (Blackline Master 3) or you can use an interactive virtual hundreds chart (several are available online). Children select any four numbers in the hundreds chart that form a square. They are to add the two numbers on each diagonal as in the example shown here. For younger children or children who struggle, allow them to use calculators so that they can explore the pattern without getting bogged down in computations.<span id="page275" class="pagebreak" title="275"/></p>
<figure class="figure lc_img25 fx-lightbox">
<img alt="A section of a hundreds chart has four numbers in a 2 by 2 array with 58 and 59 above 68 and 69. A set of crossed double ended arrows are in the center. The first arrow is pointing to 58 and 69, and the second, to 68 and 59." src="../images/unfig13-01.png"></img>
</figure>
<p>Have children share their diagonal sums and compare what happened. Then invite children to explore other diagonal sums on the chart. Ask them to describe why this pattern works. Extend their exploration to diagonals of any rectangle. For example, the numbers 15, 19, 75, and 79 form four corners of a rectangle children can explore.</p>

<p>Before reading further, stop and explore why the diagonal sums described in the previous activities are the same. What questions might you ask children to ensure they are noticing the relationship between tens and ones?</p>
</aside>
<p>Here are some additional tasks you might explore on a hundreds chart. With each task, notice how the first part is about number. The latter part asks questions that focus on generalizations (algebraic thinking).</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Pick a number. Move down two and over one. What is the relationship between the original number and the new number?</p></li>
<li><p>Skip count by different values (e.g., 2, 3, 5). Which numbers make diagonal patterns? Which numbers make column patterns? What is true about all the numbers that make a column pattern?</p></li>
<li><p>Find a two skip-count pattern in which one number lands &#8220;on top of&#8221; the other (that is, all of the shaded values for one pattern are part of the shaded values for the other)? How are these two skip-count numbers related? Is this true for any pair of numbers that have this relationship?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Asking questions such as &#8220;When will this be true?&#8221; and &#8220;Why does this work?&#8221; requires children to generalize and consequently, strengthen their understanding of the number concepts they are learning.</p>
