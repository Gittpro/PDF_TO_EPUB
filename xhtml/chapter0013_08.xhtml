</header>
<p>Noticing generalizable properties and attempting to prove that they are true is a significant form of algebraic reasoning and is at the heart of what it means to do mathematics (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_389" >Ball &amp; Bass, 2003</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_393" >Carpenter, Franke, &amp; Levi, 2003</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_420" >Schifter, 1999</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_421" >Schifter, Monk, Russell, &amp; Bastable, 2007</a>). Children can make conjectures about properties as early as first and second grade, and this must be encouraged by the teacher. For example, as first graders are exploring addition, a child might observe that the order you add two numbers does not matter <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math290_7.png" alttext="left parenthesis 1 plus 6 equals 6 plus 1 right parenthesis" altimg-height="16" altimg-width="101" class="informalequation">
<mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></math>. This idea can be presented to the group. Children can test the idea with other numbers and eventually try to explain why this is true. They can write it in symbols: <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math270_01.png" alttext="a plus b equals b plus a" altimg-height="13px" altimg-width="93px" class="informalequation"> <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>a</mi></math> (yes, first graders can understand and benefit from using variables). It is important to ask, how can this help us do math problems? For first graders, recognizing that when they see <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math290_8.png" alttext="1 plus 6" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="37" class="informalequation">
<mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn></math> that they can start with 6 and add on 1 is an important step toward learning how to add efficiently (as well as learn the basic facts).</p>

<p><strong>7 Look for and make use of structure</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>The most common form of justification for young children is the use of examples (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_419" >Russell, Schifter, &amp; Bastable, 2011</a>). Some children will be satisfied to try one or two examples. Others will try several examples but will not vary those examples in terms of size or other characteristics, such as using even and odd numbers. Still others will try very large numbers as substitutes for &#8220;any&#8221; number. Encourage children to use a wide variety of examples. After trying their examples, they may respond, &#8220;See? It works for any number you try.&#8221; Proof by example will hopefully lead to someone asking, &#8220;How do we know there still aren&#8217;t some numbers that it doesn&#8217;t work for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Children can use physical materials or representations to justify the reasoning behind the conjecture (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_08.xhtml#fig_13-4">Figure 13.4</a>). What moves this beyond &#8220;proof by example&#8221; is that the argument does not depend on particular numbers and emerges from the structure of the representation (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_419" >Schifter, Russell, &amp; Bastable, 2011</a>). Children might explain the generalization using statements such as &#8220;These could be any numbers and would work this way no matter what the numbers are.&#8221;</p>

<p>An example of the commutative property using manipulatives. The example has two sets of shaded tiles and 2 sets of not shaded tiles, with each set having a piece of paper over some of the tiles. The tiles are set up as follows: shaded set, plus not shaded set equals, not shaded set plus shaded set. Under the examples are two sentences, there could be more tiles under the paper, so these could be any numbers. It would work this way no matter what the numbers are.</p>
</details>
<p><span id="page291" class="pagebreak" title="291"/>Odd or even numbers provide an excellent context for exploring structure in our number system. All too often children are simply told that the even numbers are those that end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 and odd numbers are those that end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Although this is true, it is only an attribute of even and odd numbers rather than a definition that explains what <em>even</em> or <em>not even</em> (i.e., <em>odd</em>) really means. The next three activities help children develop conceptual ideas of even and odd numbers without forcing definitions. In fact, after these activities children should be able to describe in their own words what we mean by odd and even numbers.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>CCSS-M: 1.OA.B.3; 2.OA.C.3; 2.NBT.B.5</strong></p>
<p>Tell a story about two twin sisters (or brothers). The twins always share whatever they have equally. If they find some pretty seashells, they will count them out and share them so that each has the same number of shells. When their Mom gives them cookies for lunch, they are always sure that each get the same number of cookies. Sometimes they are not able to share things fairly because there is something left over. For example, this happened when Dad gave them five marbles. (Discuss why they could not share five marbles equally.) Whenever there is a leftover, the twins put the extra item in a special box of &#8220;leftovers&#8221; for their baby brother.</p>
<p>Now assign three or four numbers from 6 to 40 to pairs of children, depending on readiness. Their task is to decide which of their numbers could be shared fairly and which would have a leftover. Provide linking cubes to use for their investigations. Display a list of numbers that can be shared and a list of those that will have a leftover. Examine the lists as a class and ask for observations. Select numbers not in the list and ask if children can tell which list they belong in and how they know.</p>
</aside>
<p>The critical portion of &#8220;Fair Shares for Two&#8221; is the discussion about children&#8217;s investigations and findings. Notice how children use the linking cubes in their investigations. Some children will count out the number of cubes and then distribute the cubes one by one to each twin. They either keep track of the fair sharing (e.g., one for this twin, one for that twin; two for this twin, two for that twin, and so on) or they have to count at the end to determine if each twin received the same amount. Others might organize their cubes by pairing them together to make sure that each twin receives the same amount (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_08.xhtml#fig_13-5">Figure 13.5</a>). Have children share how they used their linking cubes and ask how can they quickly see whether the twins received the same amount. Challenge the children to use their own words to describe the numbers that can be fairly shared (evens) and those that cannot (odds). Based on this activity, <em>an even number is an amount that can be shared fairly or split into two equal parts with no leftovers. An odd number is one that cannot be split into two equal parts.</em> The number endings (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8) are only an interesting and useful pattern or observation and should not be used in their definition (of an even number).</p>

Children are to work together to describe as many things as they can about the pieces.
(For example: There are cards for each number 1 to 10. Some are like rectangles. Some have a part sticking out.) For those who need help to get started, suggest that they put the cards in order from one to ten. After having some time to explore and share ideas they have noticed, ask children to find a way to sort their cards into two sets. If no pair sorts the cards like in <span id="page292" class="pagebreak" title="292"/><a class="xref" href="chapter0013_08.xhtml#fig_13-6">Figure 13.6</a>, do so on a projector and ask what rule you are using to sort the cards. Use children&#8217;s language to describe the pieces representing the odd numbers. For example, someone may describe the seven card as having a &#8220;bump.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, assign the pairs of children three or four numbers between 11 and 50 and have them decide whether two-column cards for these numbers would have bumps or no bumps (or whatever language children used). Provide linking cubes for their investigations. Ask them to use words and pictures to explain their conclusions.</p>
<p>To extend &#8220;Bumps or No Bumps,&#8221; ask children what kind of card they will get when two cards in the set are added together to create a new two-column card.</p>

<p>Think for a moment how you might prove that the sum of two odd numbers is always even. How might the two-column cards used in the activity &#8220;Bumps or No Bumps&#8221; be useful?</p>
</aside>
<p>As in &#8220;Fair Shares for Two,&#8221; challenge the children to use their own words to describe the numbers. In &#8220;Bumps or No Bumps,&#8221; <em>an even number is an amount that can be formed into pairs (i.e., the columns) with no leftovers. An odd number is an amount that, after forming pairs, will always has one not paired.</em> After refining children&#8217;s definitions of these numbers, you can introduce the terms <em>even</em> and <em>odd.</em> Children will notice see that numbers with &#8220;bumps&#8221; end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 and even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Again, these characteristics should not be included in the definitions.</p>
<p>After experiences with &#8220;Fair Shares for Two&#8221; and &#8220;Bumps or No Bumps,&#8221; the next activity moves children&#8217;s thinking about evens and odds to a more abstract level.</p>

<p>For children with disabilities, provide linking cubes so they can concretely model numbers to support their thinking. Invite early finishers to take on the other problem or to write their justifications using variables. In the follow-up discussion, ask children for other patterns or generalizations they notice about odd and even numbers.</p>
</aside>
<p>Making, testing, and proving conjectures should become a routine activity in your classroom (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_419" >Russell, Schifter, &amp; Bastable, 2011</a>). This next activity suggests one way to make this happen.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch13-Activity-13-16">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch13-Activity-13-16">Activity 13.16 Convince Me Conjectures</h2></header>

<figure class="figure_wrap">

</figure>
<p>To begin, offer children a conjecture to test (see <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Conjecture_Cards.pdf" class="ulink">Conjecture Cards for K-2</a> for ideas). For example, &#8220;If you add one to one addend and take one away from the other addend, the answer will be the same.&#8221; Ask children to (1) test the conjecture and (2) prove it is true for any number. Point out the difference between testing and proving. Testing is seeing if the conjecture is true for specific examples. Proving is providing a convincing argument (visual or explanation) that the conjecture will work for <em>all</em> numbers. Then, invite children to create (in words) their own conjecture that they believe is always true. Then they must prepare a visual or explanation to convince others that it is always true.</p>
<p>All children, particularly ELLs, may struggle with correct and precise terms. When needed, &#8220;revoice&#8221; their ideas using appropriate phrases to help them learn to communicate mathematically, but be careful to not make this the focus&#8212;the focus should be on the ideas presented. Children with disabilities will benefit from the presentation and discussion of counterexamples.</p>
</aside>
<p><em>Using</em> and <em>applying</em> the properties is central to mathematical proficiency&#8212;it is not only emphasized in the CCSS-M content, but also in the Mathematical Practices (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_395" >CCSSO, 2010</a>). An explicit focus on seeking generalizations and looking for structure is also important in supporting the range of learners in the classroom from those who struggle to those who excel (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_422" >Schifter, Russell, &amp; Bastable, 2009</a>). Doing so requires planning&#8212;deciding what problems to pose and what questions to ask to help children think about generalized ideas&#8212;across the mathematical strands, not just during the &#8220;algebra&#8221; unit.</p>
