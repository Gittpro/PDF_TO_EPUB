<h2 class="title">Patterns and Functions</h2>
</header>
<p>Patterns are found in all areas of mathematics. Learning to look for, describe, and extend patterns are important processes in thinking algebraically. Two of the eight mathematical practices (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_395" >CCSSO, 2010</a>) actually begin with the phrase &#8220;look for,&#8221; implying that children who are mathematically proficient pay attention to patterns as they do mathematics. Functional thinking begins in preK&#8722;2 when children make observations like, &#8220;Each person we add to the group means we add 2 more feet&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_392" >Blanton et al., 2011</a>).</p>
<p><span id="page294" class="pagebreak" title="294"/>In grades preK&#8722;2, repeating and then growing patterns have often been a primary focus, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the <em>Common Core State Standards</em>. This does not mean that patterns are not useful. In fact, patterns provide opportunities for children to look for structure and express regularity in situations. The point is that the goal is not to have children do patterns just to do patterns; rather, children should be engaged in looking for, describing, and extending patterns to help them develop the skills to look for structure and express regularity in all mathematical situations.</p>

<p>When possible, patterning activities should involve some form of physical materials. Many kindergarten and first-grade textbooks have pages where children are shown a picture of a pattern such as a string of colored beads. The task is to color the last few beads in the string according to the pattern. There are a few differences between this and the same activity done with physical materials. First, by coloring on the page without an initial investigation with physical materials, the activity takes on a sense of right versus wrong rather than a sense-making activity. If a mistake is made, correction on the page is difficult and can cause frustration. Physical materials, on the other hand, allow a trial-and-error approach that can allow for learning from mistakes or missteps. Second, pattern activities on worksheets prevent children from extending patterns beyond the few spaces provided on the page. By using materials such as colored blocks, buttons, and connecting cubes, children gain more experience thinking about patterns because the patterns can be extended well beyond those few spaces. Plus, by using a variety of materials to create patterns, children can begin to generalize patterns across the different materials.</p>

<h3 id="chap13-head3_8" class="title">Repeating Patterns</h3>
</header>
<p>Repeating patterns are those patterns that have a core that repeats. For example, if red-blue is the core, a string of beds could be used to continue to repeat this pattern: red-blue-red-blue-red-blue . . . . Notice in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-7">Figure 13.7</a> that the core is always fully repeated and never only partially shown.</p>

<p>A pattern of multilink cubes is 1 cube, 2 cubes, 1 cube, 2 cubes and continues forming an, Ay, B pattern. A pattern of pattern blocks where the blocks fit together to form a parallelogram is a trapezoid with the longer base down, a rhombus slanted left, a trapezoid with the shorter base down, a rhombus slanted right and continues forming an Ay B, C, D pattern. A pattern of 2 color counters is 2 red counters, 2 yellow counter and continues forming an Ay, Ay, B, B pattern. A pattern of color tiles is 2 stacked tiles, 1 tile, 1 tile, 1 tile, and continues forming an Ay, B, B, B pattern.</p>
</details>
<p>An important goal when working with repeating patterns is to help children identify the <em>core</em> of the pattern (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_425" >Warren &amp; Cooper, 2008</a>). One possible way to emphasize the core is to place shape patterns under a document camera, state aloud what is there and ask what comes next. After adding on a few shapes, ask children to describe the pattern. To help children, especially those with disabilities, track on the core of the pattern, highlight the core by drawing a circle around the shapes that form the core, repeating the circle each time the core is repeated. You can also highlight the core by labeling the pattern with letters as shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-7">Figure 13.7</a>. For example, the first pattern in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-7">Figure 13.7</a> shows an AB pattern because the core has two different elements, A and B. The red-blue pattern described earlier is also an AB pattern. An ABBB pattern (the last pattern shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-7">Figure 13.7</a>) uses 2 different elements but because B is repeated 3 times, the core has 4 elements.</p>

<p>When first starting to work with patterns, ask children to describe three things they notice. Once they share their ideas, then point out the pattern if no one else does, and ask them, &#8220;What comes next?&#8221;</p>
</aside>
<p>Repeating patterns are everywhere! The seasons, days of the week, and months of the year are just a beginning. Challenge children to find real-life AB patterns&#8212;for example, &#8220;day, night,&#8221; &#8220;open a door, close the door,&#8221; &#8220;to school, home from school,&#8221; or &#8220;set the table before eating, clear table after eating.&#8221; Children&#8217;s books often have patterns in repeating rhymes, words, or phrases. <em>Pattern Fish</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_400" >Harris, 2000</a>) and <em>My Mom and Dad Make Me Laugh</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_423" >Sharratt, 1996</a>) are two great choices. A very long repeating pattern can be found in <em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_417" >Numeroff, 1985</a>) (or any books in this series), in which each event eventually leads back to giving a mouse a cookie, with the implication that the sequence would be repeated. In addition, you can recite oral patterns. For example, &#8220;do, mi, mi, do, <span id="page295" class="pagebreak" title="295"/>mi, mi, . . .&#8221; is a simple singing pattern. Also, body movements such as moving the arm up, sideways, and then down can be used to make patterns: up, side, down, up, side, down (ABC).</p>

<p>There are numerous websites that offer children opportunities to explore repeating patterns. For example, PBS Kids offers several interactive pattern activities for young children (search for PBS Kids patterns). An Activity called &#8220;Patch Tool&#8221; on NCTM&#8217;s Illuminations website allows children to flip and rotate shapes to create various patterns, which informally introduces them to geometric transformations while they explore patterns. The National Library of Virtual Manipulatives also has several applets that support the exploration of repeated (and growing) patterns, including Attribute Trains, Color Patterns, and Pattern Blocks.</p>

<p>The following activity helps children work on identifying the core of a pattern.</p>

<p>Show six or seven patterns with different materials or pictures (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-8">Figure 13.8</a> for examples). In pairs, one child closes his eyes while the other child uses the A, B, C method to read a pattern that you point to. After hearing the pattern, the child who had his eyes closed examines the patterns and identifies which pattern was read. If two of the patterns in the list have the same structure, the discussion can be very interesting.<span id="page296" class="pagebreak" title="296"/></p>

<p>The first set of objects a series of bread tags, from left to right as follows: a small blue upward tag, large red downward tag, large tan downward tag, small tan upward tag, large blue downward tag, large red downward tag. The second set is pattern blocks, a trapezoid with the longer base down and a triangle on top, a rhombus slanted left, a trapezoid with the shorter base down, a rhombus slanted right, a trapezoid with the longer base down and a triangle on top, a rhombus slanted left, a trapezoid with the shorter base down, a rhombus slanted right. The third set is keys: a key pointing up, a key pointing up, a key pointing down, a key pointing down, a key pointing up, a key pointing up, a key pointing down, a key pointing down. The fourth set is paper shapes: a triangle, a rectangle, a circle, a circle, a triangle, a rectangle, a circle, a circle. The fifth set is squares or blocks in 2 colors: 1 green block, 1 red block on 1 green block, 1 red block, 1 green block on 1 red block, 1 green block, 1 red block on 1 green block, 1 red block, 1 green block on 1 red block.</p>
</details>
<p>A significant step forward mathematically is to see that two patterns constructed with different materials are actually the same pattern. For example, the second pattern in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-7">Figure 13.7</a> and the second pattern in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-8">Figure 13.8</a> can both be &#8220;read&#8221; A-B-C-D-A-B-C-D, and the third pattern in both figures is A-A-B-B-A-A-B-B. Translating two or more patterns with the same structure into some form of symbolism (in this case, the alphabet) moves beyond doing patterns for the sake of doing patterns and helps children gain experience with generalization.</p>

<p>Give each child a pattern strip like those shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_09.xhtml#fig_13-8">Figure 13.8</a> and a set of materials that is different from that on the pattern strip. Have children make a pattern with the set of materials that has the same structure as the pattern on the strip. You can also mix up the pattern strips and have children find strips that have the same pattern structure. To test if two patterns are the same, children can translate each of the strips into a third set of materials or they can write down the A, B, C pattern for each.</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page297" class="pagebreak" title="297"/>After children have experiences identifying, building, and extending repeating patterns, you can step up the challenge by introducing a functional aspect to their work by asking them to predict which element will be in a particular position, as done in the next activity.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch13-Activity-13-19">
<header><h2 class="title" id="ch13-Activity-13-19">Activity 13.19 Predict Down the Line</h2></header>

<img alt="" role="presentation" src="../images/activity.png"></img>
</figure>
<p><strong>CCSS-M: K.MD.B.3; K.G.A.1; K.G.B.4; 1.G.A.2; 2.OA.C.3</strong></p>
<p>Provide children with a pattern to extend (e.g., ABC pattern made with colored links). Before children begin to extend the pattern, have them predict exactly what elements (colored links) will be in, say, the twelfth position. (Notice that in an ABC pattern the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth terms are the C element because they are multiples of 3.) After children predict, have them complete the pattern to check. Ask them how they knew. You can differentiate this lesson by starting with a more basic AB pattern or by having different groups of children work on different types of patterns based on their readiness. Children should be required to provide a reason for their prediction in writing supported with visuals. After the discussion, extend the challenge by asking children to predict what element will be in a position further down the line, such as the 20th or 24th position. Again, children should be required to provide a reason for their prediction.</p>
</aside>
<p>In &#8220;Predict Down the Line, &#8220;some children will check their prediction by continuing to build onto the patterns they had already constructed. Others may combine their 12-cube pattern with a partner&#8217;s and use the new 24-cube pattern to check their prediction. Still others may use skip counting by 3s to help them check their prediction.</p>
