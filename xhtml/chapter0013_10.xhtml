</header>
<p>Growing patterns, which involve a progression from step to step, are precursors to functional relationships and should be explored in the primary grades. In technical terms, these patterns are called <em>sequences;</em> we will simply call them <em>growing patterns.</em> With these patterns, children identify the core, but they also look for a generalization or a relationship that will tell them how the core is changing&#8212;and, ultimately, in later grades, what the pattern will be at any point along the way (e.g., the <em>n</em>th term).</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s experiences with growing patterns should start with fairly straightforward patterns using visuals, such as those in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_10.xhtml#fig_13-9">Figure 13.9</a>. Geometric patterns made with physical materials (e.g., tiles, counters, cubes) are good exemplars because the pattern is easier to see (than with numbers) and because children can manipulate the objects.<span id="page298" class="pagebreak" title="298"/></p>

<p>Example ay has multilink cubes in groupings as follows: step 1 is 1 dark cube, step 2 adds on 2 lighter cubes, step 3 adds 3 dark cubes. Example b, pattern blocks. Step 1: 3 equilateral triangles are arranged to for a larger equilateral triangle, with apexes pointing outward and a space in at the center. Step 2: 3 triangles are added at each corner, with apexes pointing outward. Step 3: 3 more triangles are added, in line with the previous 3 added. Example c, color tiles. Step 1: the corners of a central square connect to the corners of 4 additional squares, extending outward diagonally. Step 2: a second set of 5 squares is added below the first, so that the lower and upper squares in each are touching. Step 3: a third set of 5 squares is added, below the second, again so that squares are touching. Example d, multilink or centimeter cubes. Step 1: a row of 2 cubes is placed above and to the right of a second row of 2 cubes, so that 1 cube from each overlaps. Step 2: this pattern of 4 cubes is repeated, with the lower row of the new set directly above the upper row of the original set. Step 3: another set of 4 cubes is added, continuing the upward and rightward trend. Example e,color tiles or paper squares. Step 1: a row of 3 squares, and a fourth square below the center upper square. Step 2: 1 square is added to the horizontal row, 2 squares are added to the 1 square below to form a vertical row, and the vertical row is shifted to be at the center of the horizontal row. Step 3: 1 square is added to the horizontal row, 2 added to the vertical row, and the vertical row is shifted to the center of the horizontal row.</p>

<p><a class="xref" href="chapter0013_10.xhtml#fig_13-9">Figure 13.9(d)</a> is a growing pattern in which a square made of 4 cubes is added to the middle as you go from one step to the next. Describing how a growing pattern changes from step to step is known as <em>recursive</em> thinking (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_390" >Bezuszka &amp; Kenny, 2008</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_391" >Blanton, 2008</a>) and is how most younger children will be able to reason about these kinds of patterns. Therefore, when discussing a growing pattern, encourage children to consider how each step in the pattern differs from the preceding step. When a child observes that each new step can be built by adding on to or changing the previous step, the discussion should include a demonstration of how this can be done. Circling or color coding the part that is the same in adjacent terms can help identify what is changing.</p>

<p>Two important questions help children analyze growing patterns in order to determine the general relationship: What is staying the same? What is changing?</p>

<p>Before reading further, what is the relationship between the steps in the each of the patterns shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_10.xhtml#fig_13-9">Figure 13.9</a>? What changes from the first step to the second step? From the second step to the third step?</p>

<p><span id="page299" class="pagebreak" title="299"/>Each triangle design in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_10.xhtml#fig_13-9">Figure 13.9(b)</a> can be made by adding three triangles to the corners of the preceding design. Circle the three triangles in the center of each design to highlight what is staying the same. The pattern in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_10.xhtml#fig_13-9">Figure 13.9(e)</a> involves adding three tiles to each new figure, two to the vertical part and one to the horizontal part of the figure. You can use color coding to highlight what is changing from one figure to the next.</p>
