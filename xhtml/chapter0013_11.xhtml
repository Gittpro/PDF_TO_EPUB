</header>
<p>Although young children initially use recursive thinking when making sense of growing patterns, they can be encouraged to explore more sophisticated functional thinking using input&#8211;output activities. The children&#8217;s book <em>Two of Everything</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_401" >Hong, 1993</a>) works well for this purpose because it describes putting things &#8220;in a magic pot&#8221; and then taking things &#8220;out of the pot.&#8221; The book tells the story of a magic pot in which anything that falls into it is doubled, but that rule can be changed to explore other relationships. (See <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_411" >McNamara [2010]</a> for ideas for using this book with second graders.)</p>
<p>The next activity builds on a similar idea by creating a function machine. Shoeboxes or large refrigerator boxes can be turned into input&#8211;output boxes. Decorate the box to look like a machine and add buttons labeled &#8220;easy,&#8221; &#8220;medium,&#8221; and &#8220;hard,&#8221; and design functions that are appropriate for your children (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_397" >Fisher, Roy, &amp; Reeves, 2013</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;What Is My Rule&#8221; can be played with the whole class, or children can play in small groups, perhaps as a station activity. Provide a collection of rules on cards, such as &#8220;double the input number and add 1<em>.</em>&#8221; Include at least three examples so that the function machine operator is sure to understand the rule (e.g., 3 &#8594; 7; 6 &#8594; 13; 10 &#8594; 21).</p>
<p>Children suggest input numbers and the &#8220;operator&#8221; indicates the output. A list of in&#8211;out pairs is kept on the board, as shown in <a class="xref" href="chapter0013_11.xhtml#fig_13-10">Figure 13.10</a>, for children to refer to as they reason to determine the rule. Children who think they have determined the rule can hold their thumbs up to their chest. As more numbers are put into the machine, those children tell what comes out. Continue until most children have determined the rule.</p>
<p>Eventually children can make up their own rules to try to stump their classmates.</p>
