</header>
<p>Our number system is also full of wonderful patterns that can be useful to children for counting and making sense of number relationships and place value ideas. The simplest form of a number pattern is a string of numbers that follows some rule for determining how the <span id="page300" class="pagebreak" title="300"/>string continues. The following activity includes some repeating patterns and some growing patterns as well as a few other types of relationships.</p>

<p>This activity can be done as a whole class or in pairs at a station. Provide children five or six numbers from a number pattern. Children are to extend the pattern for several more numbers and explain the rule for generating the pattern. The difficulty of the task depends on the number pattern and how familiar the children are with searching for patterns. Here are some recommended patterns to try.</p>
<p>1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, . . . a simple alternating pattern</p>
<p>1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, . . . each digit repeats according to its value</p>
<p>2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . . even numbers&#8212;skip counting by 2</p>
<p>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . double the previous number</p>
<p>2, 5, 11, 23, . . . double the previous number and add 1</p>
<p>1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, . . . successively increase the skip count</p>
<p>2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, . . . add the preceding two numbers</p>
<p>Have children make up their own number pattern rules to challenge their classmates.</p>
</aside>
<p>You can use a calculator to skip-count by any amount beginning anywhere. For example, to count by fives, enter 0+5 = . (The 0 isn&#8217;t necessary but is a good idea with young children.) Successive presses of the = key will count on from 5 by fives. To skip count by fives from a different number, say, 16, simply press 16+5 and continue pressing the = key. The calculator &#8220;remembers&#8221; the last operation, in this case; &#8220;+5,&#8221; and adds that to whatever is currently in the window whenever the
= key is pressed. The = will continue to have this effect until an operation key is pressed. The next activity uses the calculator as a tool to explore patterns.</p>

<p>Teach children how to make their calculators skip count by different numbers. As they work in pairs, challenge them to say the next number before pressing the = key. Have them hold their finger over the = button and say the next skip count, press the = to confirm or correct, and then continue, always trying to say the next count before pressing the key. Record the numbers on the board or chart paper as they are displayed on the calculator so children can refer back to them to describe the patterns they see. Providing a <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM3_Hundreds_Chart.pdf" class="ulink">Hundreds Chart</a> (Blackline Master 3) for children to record their number sequences is also helpful, especially for children with disabilities. For example, when counting by twos starting with 0, they see numbers ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, and then that pattern repeats.</p>
<p>When children are comfortable starting their skip counting from zero, teach them how to use the calculator to start at a different number, and note any patterns. For example, what do they notice about the number sequence when they begin with any even number, such as 34, and skip count by twos? What happens if they count by twos and begin with 1?</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page301" class="pagebreak" title="301"/>When children have become comfortable skip counting by small numbers, suggest that they try skip counting by a &#8220;big&#8221; number such as 20 or 50. Children will be surprised to see familiar patterns in the tens and hundreds places. Continue as appropriate with challenges to count by other numbers such as 15, 25, or 30.</p>

<p><strong>1 Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>Focusing on patterns in skip counting will support children&#8217;s use of invented strategies for addition as well as multiplication. In fact, a key reason for exploring number patterns in the elementary curriculum is to strengthen children&#8217;s understanding of number relationships and properties. The more often you ask children, &#8220;Did you notice a pattern?,&#8221; and then expect them to explain the pattern, the more often they are making sense of the mathematics they are doing.</p>
