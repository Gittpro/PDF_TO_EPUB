<h2 class="title">Models for Fractions</h2>
</header>
<p>Substantial evidence suggests that the effective use of visuals in fraction tasks is important in building children&#8217;s understanding of fractions (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_433" >Cramer &amp; Henry, 2002</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_439" >Empson &amp; Levi, 2011</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_452" >Petit, Laird, Marsden, &amp; Ebby, 2016</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_457" >Siebert &amp; Gaskin, 2006</a>). Unfortunately, when textbooks incorporate visuals or manipulatives, they tend to use only area models (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_442" >Hodges, Cady, &amp; Collins, 2008</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_465" >Watanabe, 2007</a>). Using a variety of physical tools that represent both continuous and discrete quantities is critical for children to make sense of fractions <span id="page307" class="pagebreak" title="307" /> as they explore fractions in a variety of situations (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_458" >Siegler et al., 2010</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_468" >Zhang, Clements, &amp; Ellerton, 2015</a>).</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="#Tab_14-1">Table 14.1</a> provides a quick overview of three types of models&#8212;area, length, and set&#8212;defining the wholes and their related parts for each model. Using different models for fractions can enhance children&#8217;s understanding as the models offer different opportunities or ways to think about fraction ideas. For example, an area model can be helpful in visualizing parts of a whole as well as the relationship between the size of the part to the whole while a linear model can reinforce the notion of a fraction as a measure. When appropriate, doing the same activity with two different representations and asking children to make comparisons between them can help clarify ideas.</p>

<p>It is important for children to experience fractions through contexts that are meaningful to them (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_434" >Cramer &amp; Whitney, 2010</a>). These contexts may align well with one representation and not as well with another. For example, if children are being asked who walked the farthest, a linear model will be better than an area model in supporting their thinking.</p>

<p><a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Circular%20Fraction%20Pieces_1-2.pdf" class="ulink">Circular fraction pieces</a> are by far the most commonly used area model. One advantage of the circular model is that it emphasizes the part&#8211;whole concept of fractions and so are good for introductory activities but they also can be used to emphasize the relative size of a part to the whole (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_435" >Cramer, Wyberg, &amp; Leavitt, 2008</a>). What is being compared is the area of the part to the area of the whole. Because we can cut area into as many equal-sized pieces as we want and because area is measured, it falls into the category of a continuous quantity. Notice that when drawing circles, children (and adults) can find it difficult to partition the circle into reasonably equal-sized parts. Regions, such as rectangles, can be drawn on blank or grid paper and are easier to partition. There are many other area models including pattern blocks, geoboards, color tiles, and fraction bars. The physical models in <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_1">Figure 14.1</a> demonstrate how different shapes can represent the whole.</p>

<p>A set of circular pie pieces has a circle and 6 parts of a circle each with a curved side and 2 radii sides. A set of rectangular regions where any piece can be selected as the whole is 8 rectangles of varied sizes. A 5 by 5 geoboard has the vertical center column and the horizontal center row circled to show fourths on a geoboard.  Drawings on grids or dot paper show a 3 by 5 array of squares outlined with a row of 5 shaded, labeled one-third and 3 by 3 rows of connected dots that form 4 connected rhombus with 2 of the rhombus shaded, labeled one-half or two-fourths. A set of pattern blocks has a hexagon with a triangle on top, two trapezoids that form a hexagon and 2 rhombuses. An example of paper folding has a piece of paper folded horizontally once then vertically twice to form a 2 by 4 array of rectangles.</p></details>
<p><span id="page308" class="pagebreak" title="308" />Too often we only provide area models for children that are already partitioned into equal-sized parts so they do not have to attend to this critical feature of fractional parts (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_465" >Watanabe, 2007</a>). It is important to provide children opportunities to explicitly confront this issue of equal-sized parts. Activities like <a class="xref" href="chapter0014_05.xhtml#activity-14-1">Activity 14.1</a> provide such opportunities.</p>

Shape b, is a rectangle divided horizontally into 2 equal parts with each part further divided vertically into 2 unequal parts. Shape c, is an equilateral triangle that is divided into 2 parts, by a segment that extends from a vertex to meet the center of the opposite side. Each part is further divided by a segment, parallel to, and an equal distance from the first segment. Shape d, is a rectangle that is divided into 2 equal parts by a vertical.

<p><span id="page309" class="pagebreak" title="309" />In the &#8220;Halves or Not Halves&#8221; activity, the wholes are already partitioned either correctly or incorrectly; the children are not involved in the partitioning. So the most important part of this activity is the discussion. Use the discussion to reinforce the idea that all the pieces need to be shared and shared equally. Tell children to pretend they are sharing a food that they all like and when there are unequal parts, pose questions such as &#8220;Which piece would you like and why?&#8221; and &#8220;Will everyone think they have a fair share?&#8221;</p>

<p>The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> set as an expectation for second graders that they will recognize that &#8220;equal-sized parts&#8221; does not necessarily mean the same shape when using an area model. So with second graders, make sure to include examples that illustrate this concept. The next two activities address this idea.</p>

<p>Challenge children by asking them to draw shapes that fit each of the four categories listed below for any grade appropriate fractional parts. (Notice that creating fourths and eighths tends to be easier than creating thirds and sixths because children can use a halving strategy to create fourths and eighths.)</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li><p>Same shape, same size (equivalent)</p></li>

For example, you might ask them to enclose a 4-by-2 rectangle if they are going to partition into halves or fourths, or a 3-by-6 rectangle if they are going to partition into thirds. (Make sure to point out that they are counting the space in between the dots, not the dots, to create the rectangles.) If using, say, the 4-by-2 rectangle, ask children to find a way to partition their rectangle into halves. Then have them draw another rectangle that is the same size (4-by-2) and partition it a different way to show halves. Encourage children to find a way to show halves where the halves are different shapes. See how many ways they can <span id="page310" class="pagebreak" title="310" /> find. Note that the areas do not need to be adjacent. See <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_3">Figure 14.3</a> for some possibilities. Emphasize &#8220;ths&#8221; as you say the fractional parts, particularly for ELLs who may not hear the difference between fractional parts and wholes (e.g., <em>fourths</em> sounds like &#8220;fours&#8221;). Explicitly discuss the difference between <em>four</em> areas and a <em>fourth of</em> an area. Also discuss the meaning of the words <em>whole</em> and <em>hole</em>.</p>

<p>The previous three activities offer good diagnostic interviews to assess whether children understand that it is the <em>size</em> that matters, not the shape. When working with fourths as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_2">Figure 14.2</a>, if children get all correct except (e) and (g), they hold the misconception that parts should be the same shape.
