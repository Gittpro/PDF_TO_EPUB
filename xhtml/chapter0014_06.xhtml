</header>
<p>With length models, lengths or linear measurements are compared instead of areas. In this model, a unit of length is compared to the whole length. We can cut a length into as many equal-sized pieces (units) as we want; therefore, length models represent continuous quantities. Length models appropriate for preK&#8211;2 include fraction strips, paper strips (e.g., adding-machine tape), Cuisenaire rods, and line segments (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_4">Figure 14.4</a>). All of these models provide flexibility because any length can represent the whole.</p>

<p>Researchers have identified number line models as useful in fraction instruction because they help children understand that a fraction is a quantity or a number (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_451" >Petit, Laird, &amp; Marsden, 2010</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_458" >Siegler et al., 2010</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_465" >Watanabe, 2007</a>). Locating fractions on a number line also highlights their relationship to other numbers, including other fractions. The number line has been shown as extremely effective with young children when working with whole numbers (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_428" >Booth &amp; Siegler, 2008</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_440" >Fosnot &amp; Dolk, 2001</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_459" >Siegler &amp; Ramani, 2009</a>). Using <span id="page311" class="pagebreak" title="311" />this model with whole numbers can help prepare these children to be ready to use this model with fractions in later grades. Using line segments, a modified version of a number line, for fraction instruction in grades preK&#8211;2 is ideal. Children can develop an understanding of the number line by folding paper strips as described in <a href="chapter0014_06.xhtml#activity-14-4">Activity 14.4</a> (adapted from <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_468" >Zhang, Clements, &amp; Ellerton, 2015</a>).</p>

<p>The first is a set of fraction strips or Cuisenaire rods. The set has 4 types, all shaded differently as follows: 1 long and a set of 2 shorter that equal the 1 long, 1 mid-size and a set of 3 small that equal the length of the 1 mid-size. The second model, measurement tools, has a number line with the following tics, 0, one-fourth, one-half, three-fourths, 1, five-fourths, six-fourths, seven-fourths, 2, and a ruler with 0 to 10. The third model is a set of 4 folded paper strips of equal length that are folded into equal parts as follows: 3 parts, 4 parts, 6 parts, and 8 parts.</p></details>

<p>The <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Paper_Strip_to_Number_Line_I_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Paper Strip to Number Line I</a> Activity Page, which focuses on halves, fourths, and eighths, can be used for this activity. On this activity page, you will see several line segments that are all the same length. Give pairs of children three different colored strips of paper (e.g., blue, green, red) that are each the same length as one of the line segments on the Activity Page. Their task is to fold, say, the blue strip into two equal parts, the green strip into four equal parts, and the red strip into eight equal parts. Then they use their unfolded strips to locate various fractions (e.g., one-half, two-halves, one-fourth, two-fourths, and so on) on the number lines on the Activity Page. To reinforce the notion that three-fourths, for example, is 3 <em>one-fourths</em>, have <span id="page312" class="pagebreak" title="312" />children cut each strip into its respective unit fraction parts. They can use the unit fractions to count the fractional amounts.<br/>When your children are ready, use the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Paper_Strip_to_Number_Line_II_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Paper Strip to Number Line II</a> Activity Page, which involves thirds and sixths.</p>
