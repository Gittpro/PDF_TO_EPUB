</header>
<p>The whole in a set model is understood to be a group of objects, and subsets of the whole make up fractional parts. For example, 3 red counters are one-fourth of a group or set of 12 counters. The set of 12, in this example, represents the whole or 1. The idea of referring to a collection of counters as a single entity can make set models difficult for young children. Another challenge with set models is that children may focus on the size of the subset rather than the number of equal-sized subsets in the whole. For example, if 12 counters make a whole, then a subset of 4 counters is <em>one-third,</em> not one-fourth, because 3 equal-sized subsets make the whole. To help children with these challenges, put a loop of yarn around the set to help them &#8220;see&#8221; the whole. Then use additional pieces of yarn in a different color or sticks to group the subsets within (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_5">Figure 14.5</a>).</p>

<p>The first model is a set of 3 squares in a circle with 2 squares shaded. 2 color counters show two-thirds. The second is a 3 by 4 array of counters divided into 4 columns with 1 column of 3 counters shaded. 2 color counters in a loop of yarn show one-fourth.</p></details>
<p>Discrete objects, like two-color counters, are effective for set models. They can easily be f lipped to change their color to model various fractional parts of a whole set. Any countable objects, such as a box of crayons or a tin of muffins, can work as a set model (one box or tin could be the unit or whole). The next activity engages children in fairly sharing with a set model.</p>

<p>Give pairs of children 16 crayons in a box or clear plastic bag. Explain to the children that although there are 16 individual crayons, the &#8220;whole&#8221; consists of all 16 crayons in the box (or bag). Their task is to determine and be ready to explain how the 16
crayons can be equally shared with two, four, and then eight friends. They can use the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Sets_in_Equal_Shares_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Sets in Equal Shares</a> Activity Page to record their ideas. When children demonstrate confidence and accuracy with halves, fourths, and eighths, they can be challenged to share, say, 12 crayons with three and then six friends.</p>

<p><span id="page313" class="pagebreak" title="313" />Virtual manipulatives are available for all three models of fractions. When paired with using actual manipulatives, virtual manipulatives have been found to improve student achievement (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_446" >Moyer-Packenham, Ulmer, &amp; Anderson, 2012</a>). Your children can explore length, area, and set models of fractions using the applet called &#8220;Fractions Model&#8221; at the NCTM Illuminations website.</p>

<p>Children should have opportunities to explore fractions across the three models for fractions. A good way to assess children&#8217;s knowledge of a fractional amount is to give them the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Meaning_of_a_Fraction_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Meaning of a Fraction</a> Activity Page along with a fractional value (e.g., <em>three-fourths</em>). Their task is to think of the fractional amount in terms of <em>area, length,</em> and <em>set</em> and for each model (1) draw a picture and (2) write a sentence describing a context or example for the selected fraction.</p>
