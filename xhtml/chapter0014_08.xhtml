            <h2 class="title">Building Fractional Parts through Partitioning and Iterating</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The first goal in the development of fractions is to help children construct the idea of <em>fractional parts
                of the whole</em>&#8212;the parts that result when the whole or unit has been partitioned into
            <em>equal-sized portions or fair shares.</em> Recall that <a class="xref"
                href="chapter0014_05.xhtml#Tab_14-1">Table 14.1</a> describes the meanings of parts and wholes for each
            type of fraction model. We can build on children&#8217;s experiences of fair sharing to begin to establish
            this idea of fractional parts.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most significant ideas for children to develop about fractions is the sense that fractions are
            numbers&#8212;quantities that have values. You may not be familiar with the terms <em>partitioning</em>
            (splitting equally) and <em>iterating</em> (counting a repeated amount) but, as you will see, they connect
            to whole-number concepts you will recognize. Researchers have acknowledged for some time how important these
            two actions are to meaningfully working with fractions (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_449"
                >Olive, 2002</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_454"
                >Pothier &amp; Sawada, 1990</a>). These actions, in particular, emphasize the
            numerical nature of fractions. Look to create and use tasks embedded in contexts that explicitly require
            children to engage in these actions. When children explain how they thought about fractional situations,
            listen for these ideas.</p>
        <header>
            <h3 id="chap14-head3_7" class="title">Partitioning</h3>
        </header>
        <p><em>Partitioning</em> can be thought of as splitting or cutting a quantity equally. Young children are
            engaged in the act of partitioning from an early age when they split a group of 6 into 3 and 3 or when they
            share items among family and friends. Given children&#8217;s experiences with fairly sharing items among
            family and friends, sharing tasks are a good place to begin the development of fractions (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_458" >Siegler et al., 2010</a>). Sharing tasks
            allow children to develop concepts of fractions from an activity that makes sense to them, rather than
            having the structure imposed on them. In this approach children do not begin with traditional
            part&#8211;whole tasks of identifying halves, thirds, fourths, and so on. These fractional parts and
            children&#8217;s understanding of part&#8211;whole fractions emerge as a result of their fair sharing in
            meaningful contexts. See <a
                    href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/Expanded_Lesson_Equal_Sharing_Stories_for_Early_Fractions.pdf"
                    class="ulink">Expanded Lesson: Equal Sharing Stories for Early Fractions</a> for a lesson
            designed for grades 1 or 2.</p>
        <p><span id="page314" class="pagebreak" title="314" />Sharing tasks are generally posed in the form of a story
            problem involving a given number of objects that are to be shared equally among a given number of people:
            <em>Four friends share two cookies. How many cookies will each friend get?</em> The problems become more
            difficult by increasing the numbers of objects to be shared or increasing the number of sharers, for
            example: <em>Suppose there are four cookies to be shared fairly with three children. How much will each
                child get?</em> You can see how <a
                    href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/G6SH1VubUjgRTAvx_Vn6jpEbPNrFMxtw"
                    class="ulink">Eduardo</a> reasons about this sharing situation. Like Eduardo, often
            children initially solve sharing tasks by distributing items one at a time. When this process leaves
            leftover pieces, they must figure out how to subdivide so that every person (or group) gets a fair share.
            When children answer questions such as &#8220;how much will each child get?&#8221; the idea that fractions
            are numbers will be reinforced.
        </p>
        <p>Considerable research has been done with children from first through eighth grades to determine how they go
            about the process of forming fair shares and how the tasks posed to children inf luence their responses
            (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_439" >Empson &amp; Levi, 2011</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_444" >Lamon, 2012</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_445" >Mack, 2001</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_454" >Pothier &amp; Sawada, 1990</a>; <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_458" >Siegler et al., 2010</a>). Researchers
            recommend following a progression of sharing tasks that builds on children&#8217;s understanding of
            whole-number quantities and informal partitioning strategies (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_439"
                >Empson &amp; Levi, 2011</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_458"
                >Siegler et al., 2010</a>). <a class="xref" href="#Tab_14_2">Table 14.2</a>

            <li>
                <p><em>Begin with equal sharing problems whose solutions are whole numbers.</em> To begin with, it is
                    easier for young children to share fairly a number of discrete objects (e.g., 14 apples with 7
                    people) than for them to share fairly one object (e.g., 1 pancake with 4 children). So begin with
                    equal sharing situations in which the quantities to be shared are discrete objects with whole number
                    solutions. (Again, these situations are the same as the partition or fair-sharing (i.e., division)
                    problems discussed in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.) In the
                    <em>before</em> and the <em>after</em> portions of the lessons, emphasize that all of the objects
                    must be shared and shared equally. This is an important idea to stress because once the scenarios
                    require partitioning quantities into smaller pieces, some children will either not share all of the
                    objects or not share them equally.

            <li>
                <p><em>Use equal sharing problems with 2, 4, or 8 sharers and whose solutions are mixed numbers.</em>
                    Because children&#8217;s initial strategies for sharing single objects involve halving, begin with
                    2, 4, and then 8 sharers. Using problems that have solutions that are larger than 1 enable children
                    to relate their understanding of whole numbers to fractions and they actually find them easier to
                    solve than problems whose solutions are less than 1.</p>

            <li>
                <p><em>Use equal sharing problems with 2, 4, or 8 sharers and whose solutions are less than 1.</em>
                    Again, problems with 2, 4, or 8 sharers capitalize on children&#8217;s halving strategies. Problems
                    with solutions less than 1 tend to be more difficult for young children because they have to
                    anticipate how to partition.</p>

                        sharers and whose solutions are mixed numbers.</em>
                    For 3 sharers, children have to anticipate how to slice or cut the objects. Many children will
                    attempt to use a repeated halving strategy or trial and error. Moving to 3 (and then 6 sharers) will
                    force children to confront their tendencies to use halving strategies.</p>

                <p><em>Use equal sharing problems with 3 sharers and whose solutions are less than 1</em>. Again,
                    children have to anticipate how to partition the objects.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>As discussed in other chapters, when using story problems to help children construct mathematical ideas,
            having children share their solutions and explain their reasoning to each other is key. Make sure to look
            for significant ideas in children&#8217;s work while they are solving the story problems that you can then
            highlight in the discussion (<em>after</em>) portion of the lesson.</p>
        <p>Sharing brownies is a classic activity that focuses on partitioning to create equal shares (see for example,
            <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_438" >Empson, 2002</a>, and <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_456" >Russell &amp; Economopoulos, 2008</a>).
            Using concrete tools that can be partitioned, such as play dough, squares of cheese, or paper rectangles,
            can make sharing activities accessible even for prekindergartners (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_436"
                >Cwikla, 2014</a>).

            <p>Give each child some play dough and a plastic knife. Explain that they are going to be finding a way to
                share a number of brownies fairly with a group of children. Start with an example that is not too
                difficult. For example:</p>
            <p>Four friends want to share six brownies so that each friend gets the same amount of brownies. How much
                will each friend get?</p>
            <p>To ensure &#8220;brownies&#8221; of about the same size, have children use square cookie cutters to
                create their &#8220;brownies&#8221; from the play dough. (You can make square cookie cutters by
                repeatedly folding a sheet of aluminum foil until you have a long, sturdy strip of foil; cut into an
                appropriate length, fold into a square shape, and tape the ends together.) Show how to share the
                brownies fairly with four friends, using a plastic knife if necessary. Encourage children to share their
                ways of thinking about this problem. It will be helpful for many children, especially those with
                disabilities, to give them the <a

                number of brownies and the number of friends. A strategy many children will use for this problem is to
                deal out one brownie to each child and then halve each of the remaining brownies to fairly share all the
                brownies (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_6">Figure 14.6</a>). Then, pose a selection of other sharing
                tasks with different numbers of brownies and different number of sharers (see additional examples
                below).</p>

        <p>When the numbers allow for some items to be distributed whole (five shared with two), some children will
            first share whole items and then cut up the leftovers. Others will slice every piece in half and then
            distribute the halves. When there are more sharers than items, some partitioning must happen at the
            beginning of the solution process. When children who are still using a halving strategy try to share five
            things among four children, they will eventually get down to two halves to give to four children. For some,
            the solution is to cut each half in half; that is, &#8220;each child gets a whole (or two halves) and a half
            of a half.&#8221; Some children will partition each item into an equal number of sharers and then will
            distribute the pieces to each child. <a

            children get when sharing two cookies, but loses track of what the whole is in determining each
            person&#8217;s share.</p>
        <p>The last example, three brownies shared with four children, is more challenging because there are more
            sharers than items, and it involves more than just finding halves. One strategy is to partition each brownie
            into four parts and give each child one-fourth from each brownie for a total of three-fourths. Children
            (even adults) are surprised at the relationship between the problem and the answer.</p>
        <p>Partitioning into three or six equal parts is challenging for children because they naturally want to use a
            halving strategy that does not work in these cases. Here are some examples:</p>

        <p>These kinds of story problems include the following features:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>The objects in the story are easy to draw and partition (e.g., apples, carrots, bagels, granola bars,
                    cookies, brownies, quesadillas, pancakes, sticks of gum, sandwiches, pizzas, crackers, cake, candy
                    bars, sticks of modeling clay, pretzel sticks, and so on).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The story problem does not contain fractions. The fractions emerge as a result of the relationship
                    between the number of objects to be shared and the number of people sharing. This allows children to
                    make connections between their whole-number knowledge and their developing fraction knowledge.</p>

            <p>&#8220;Kids and Cookies&#8221; is an applet on the Mathlanding website where children can work on
                partitioning strategies in the context of fairly sharing cookies with friends. You can change the number
                of friends (up to 6), the shape of the cookie (round or rectangular), the number of cookies to share (up
                to 12), and the number of equal pieces you can cut a cookie into (halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, and
                sixths). The applet is also available in Spanish.</p>
        </aside>
        <p><span id="page319" class="pagebreak" title="319" />To reinforce the idea of equal shares, you may want to
            start with activities where children create designated equal shares using physical models before asking
            children to draw and partition their own representations. Patterns blocks are a good tool to use to help
            emphasize equal shares because the different pattern blocks are <em>not</em>
            equal shares (i.e., equal area). Creating shapes with pattern blocks and asking about equal shares helps
            children focus on the important idea of fair (equal) shares. For example, ask children to create a
            &#8220;cookie&#8221; using the six different pattern block shapes and ask, &#8220;Can this cookie be shared
            fairly with 6 people?&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_437" >Ellington &amp; Whitenack, 2010</a>). The answer is &#8220;no.&#8221; Then, ask
            children to build a cookie that can be shared fairly.</p>

            <p>Children do not necessarily have to consciously think of equal-sized pieces when using fraction
                manipulatives because the manipulatives automatically create the equal-sized parts. Emphasize the need

            <p>Young children can have difficulty drawing equal parts because they do not initially anticipate how to
                slice the object into equal parts (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_439" >Empson
                    &amp; Levi, 2011</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_458" >Siegler et al.,
                    2010</a>). Observe children as they draw pictures and begin to partition the objects. Note if they
                automatically begin halving for every scenario, even those for which halving will not work (e.g., 5
                children equally sharing 3 bananas). This could be an indication that they are not anticipating how to
                partition objects. Especially when partitioning into 3 and 6 equal groups, children have to pay
                attention to the relationship between the number of objects and the number of sharers.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Initially, some children do not partition amounts into equal-sized groups and, in particular, some children
            do not distinguish between the number of objects shared and the quantity shared&#8212;in other words, they
            may find an equal number of pieces without considering the size of the pieces. To develop a more
            comprehensive understanding of fractions, children need experiences partitioning regions or shapes (area
            models) as well as lengths and sets of objects.  <a class="xref" href="chapter0014_08.xhtml#activity-14-7">Activity 14.7</a> uses examples of line segments (length model)
            in which the partitioning is not completely illustrated. This can help children strengthen their
            understanding of the importance of equal parts as opposed to simply the number of parts.</p>

                    two-fourths</em>) along with fractions between 0 and 1. This helps children see that fractions can

            possibility is to cut out construction paper circles or rectangles to represent the objects to be shared.
            You could use thin rectangles to represent objects of length. Children can use connecting cubes to make bars
            that they can separate into pieces. Or they can use more traditional fraction models such as circular
            &#8220;pie&#8221; pieces (area), Cuisenaire rods (length), or counters of different colors (sets).</p>
