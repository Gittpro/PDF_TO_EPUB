        </header>
        <p>In whole-number learning, counting precedes learning to add and subtract. This is also true of fractions.
            Children should come to think of counting fractional parts in much the same way they might count apples or
            any other objects. Counting fractional parts to see how multiple parts compare to the whole helps children
            to understand the relationship between the parts and the whole. Children should be able to answer the
            question, &#8220;How many fourths are in one whole?&#8221; just as they know how many ones are in ten.
            Counting a repeated amount (e.g., unit fraction) is called <em>iterating.</em> Understanding that
            <em>three-fourths</em> can be thought of as a count of three parts called <em>fourths</em> is an important
            idea for children to develop (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_453" >Post,
                Wachsmuth, Lesh, &amp; Behr, 1985</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_457"
                >Siebert &amp; Gaskin, 2006</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_464"
                >Tzur, 1999</a>).</p>
        <p>Children should engage in counting by fractional amounts to reinforce that fractions are numbers. With young
            children, iterating or counting should be done with length or area models. (Set models are too difficult for
            young children to use for iteration.) For <span id="page321" class="pagebreak" title="321" />example,
            display some circular fractional pieces in groups as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_10">Figure
                14.10</a>. For each collection, tell children what type of piece is being shown and simply count them
            together: &#8220;<em>One</em>-fourth, <em>two</em>-fourths, <em>three</em>-fourths, <em>four</em>-fourths,
            <em>five</em>-fourths.&#8221; To reinforce the iteration or count even more, you can slightly alter your
            language to say, &#8220;<em>One</em> one-fourth, <em>two</em> one-fourths, <em>three</em>
            one-fourths,&#8221; and so on.</p>

                quesadilla or less than 1 quesadilla? The second group has 3 parts, labeled 3 fourths and a thought
                bubble, how much more to get to a second whole quesadilla? The third group is 10 parts labeled 10
                fourths, and a thought bubble, Wow! ten-fourths: How many quesadillas is that? The fourth group is 10
                parts labeled 10 thirds with the thought bubble that contains: Is ten-thirds the same as ten-fourths? Is
                it as much as five-fourths?</p>

            <p>Give children a collection of fractional parts (all the same size pieces) and indicate the kind of
                fractional part they have. (Use either area or length models. Avoid using set models for iteration with
                young children.) Parts can be drawn on a worksheet or physical models can be placed in plastic bags with
                an identifying card. For example, if done with Cuisenaire rods or fraction strips, the collection might
                have seven light green rods/strips with a caption or note indicating &#8220;each piece is an
                eighth.&#8221; The task is to decide whether the collection is less than one whole, equal to one whole,
                or more than one whole. Ask children to draw pictures and/ or use fraction words to explain their
                answer. Adding a context, such as people sharing candy bars, pizzas, or sticks of clay, can help
                children understand and reason through the problem.</p>
        </aside>
        <p><span id="page322" class="pagebreak" title="322" />As children count collections of parts, discuss the
            relationship to one whole. Make informal comparisons between different collections. &#8220;Why does it take
            more fourths to make a whole than thirds?&#8221; &#8220;Why did we get two wholes with four halves but just
            a little more than one whole with four thirds?&#8221; Take this opportunity to connect this language to
            mixed numbers. &#8220;What is another way we could say ten-fourths?&#8221; (Possible responses are two
            wholes and two-fourths, or two wholes and one-half, or one whole and six-fourths.)</p>

        <p>The next activity also uses patterns blocks to help children focus on the size of the parts as opposed to the
            number of pieces or partitions (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_431" >Champion
                &amp; Wheeler, 2014</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_437" >Ellington &amp;
                Whitenack, 2010</a>). It also provides them opportunities to continue to count fractional parts.</p>

            <p><strong>CCSS-M: 1.G.A.3; 2.G.A.3</strong></p>
            <p>Ask children to build a Pattern Block Creature that fits with a set of rules (a creature represents one
                whole). These rules can begin with just stating a fractional quantity for a color, such as &#8220;The
                red trapezoid is one-fourth of the creature.&#8221; More constraints can be added to the rules. For
                example:</p>
            <p>The yellow hexagon is one-half of the creature. Use two colors to build your creature.</p>
            <p>The blue parallelogram is one-sixth of the creature. Use at least two colors to build your creature.</p>
            <p><span id="page323" class="pagebreak" title="323" />After children build their creature based on your
                rules, have them count the fractional amounts to make sure they have an exact whole (i.e.,
                <em>one</em>-fourth, <em>two</em>-fourths, <em>three</em>-fourths, <em>four</em>-fourths).</p>
            <p>Then have them create fraction rules for their own Pattern Block Creature and sketch the outline of the
                creature on paper. Have them write their rule, such as &#8220;The red trapezoid is ______ of my
                creature.&#8221; They then trade creatures and rules with other children to see if they can figure out
                the fractional amount for each other&#8217;s creatures.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Partitioning and iterating tasks are challenging but very effective in helping children understand the
            meaning of fractions. As you create story problems and tasks for the children, remember the big ideas you
            are trying to help them construct: (1) Fractions are numbers that we can use to count and (2) fractional
            parts are equal shares or equal-sized portions of a whole or unit.</p>
