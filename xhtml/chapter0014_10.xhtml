<h3 id="chap14-head3_9" class="title">Fraction Size Is Relative</h3>
</header>
<p>Another foundational idea pertaining to fractions is that a fraction by itself does not describe the size of the whole or the size of the parts. A fraction tells us only about the <em>relationship between</em> the part and the whole. To illustrate, consider the following situation:</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="arlb14_33">
<p>Pizza Fallacy: Mark is offered the choice of a third of a pizza or a half of a pizza. Because he is hungry and likes pizza, he chooses the half. His friend Jane gets a third of a pizza but ends up with more than Mark. How can that be?</p>

<summary>Expand/collapse description</summary>
<p>Two circles are divided and shaded. The first is divided into 2 parts with 1 part shaded, labeled one-half of a pizza. The second is divided into two unequal parts with the smaller part shaded, labeled one-third of a pizza.  Do you want half of a pizza or a third of a pizza?</p></details>
</aside>
<p>The visual illustrates how Mark was mistaken in his choice. The point of the &#8220;pizza fallacy&#8221; is that whenever two or more fractions are discussed in the same context, one cannot assume (as Mark did) that the fractions are all parts of the same size whole. Teachers can help children become aware of the crucial idea that a fraction is necessarily related to its whole by regularly asking, &#8220;What is the whole?&#8221; or &#8220;What is the unit?&#8221;</p>
