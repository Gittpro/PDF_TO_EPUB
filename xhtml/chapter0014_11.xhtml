<h2 class="title">Fraction Equivalence and Comparison</h2></header>
<p>Look for opportunities when children are solving equal-sharing story problems in which they have what appear to be different answers but which are actually equivalent amounts. For example, for the problem <em>4 children equally share 6 pancakes,</em> one child may distribute one <span id="page324" class="pagebreak" title="324" />whole pancake to each person and then halve the remaining two and say that each person gets <em>one and one-half</em> pancakes<em>.</em> A second child may also distribute one whole pancake to each person but partition the remaining two pancakes into fourths and say that each person gets <em>one and two-fourths.</em> A third child may partition each of the 6 pancakes into 4 equal parts (fourths) and say that each person gets <em>six-fourths.</em> (See <a class="xref" href="#fig_14_11">Figure 14.11</a>.) Use the children&#8217;s solutions to help them see that the same quantity is shared in each case.</p>

<p>Four children equally share 6 pancakes. How much does each child get? Solution 1: Give each child one pancake. Then halve the remaining 2 pancakes. Give each child one-half of a pancake. each child gets one and one-half pancakes. A diagram has 4 stick figures each with a circle. Two additional circles are divided into 2 equal parts each with an arrow that extends from each part to one of the whole circles. One stick figure has their whole circle and the corresponding half circle shaded. Solution 2: Give each child one pancake. Then cut the remaining 2 pancakes into fourths. Give each child one-fourth of each pancake. Each child gets one and two-fourths pancakes. A diagram has 4 stick figures each with a circle. Two additional circles are divided into 4 equal parts each with an arrow that extends from each part of each circle to one of the stick figures. One stick figure has their whole circle and the corresponding 2 quarter circles shaded. Solution 3: Cut all the pancakes into fourths. Give each child one-fourth of each pancake. Each child gets six-fourths pancakes. A diagram has 4 stick figures and six circles with each circle divided into 4 equal parts with 1 part shaded. One circle has a line extending from each of the parts to each of the stick figures.</p></details>
<p>Like <a class="xref" href="chapter0014_05.xhtml#activity-14-3">Activity 14.3</a>, the following activity has children purposefully looking for different ways to partition the same quantity.</p>

<p>Pose a sharing story problem for which children could partition the objects in multiple ways. For example, &#8220;<em>4 children share 10 brownies so that each one will get the same amount. How much will each child get?&#8221;</em> Tell children that their task is to find at least two different ways to share the objects. Some children will use trial and error while others will be more systematic in finding different ways to partition the objects. Have children share the different ways they have found to partition the objects. Then challenge them to determine if the different ways result in each child getting a different or equal amount of brownie. Have children explain their reasoning.</p>

<p>The next activity uses the idea of a missing value to challenge children to find equivalent fractional amounts. This activity provides a genuine problem for second graders.</p>

<figure class="figure_wrap">
<img alt="" role="presentation" src="../images/activity.png"></img>
</figure>
<p><strong>CCSS-M: 1.G.A.3; 2.G.A.3</strong></p>
<p>Pose a problem such as the following: &#8220;<em>Suppose 6 children shared 8 cookies equally. If 3 more children arrive, how many cookies would you need if you want to give them the same amount as the first 6 children?&#8221;</em> Some children will share 8 cookies equally among the 6 children to determine how much each person will get in that situation and then use that information to determine how much is needed for the additional 3 children. Others may reason that because 3 is half of 6, they can halve the 8 cookies to see that 4 cookies are needed for the additional 3 children. Make sure to have children share their reasoning for keeping it fair!</p>
</aside>
<p>Once children are successful with equal sharing problems over an extended period of time (months, not days), you can pose situations where children compare fractional amounts. Fair-sharing situations offer productive opportunities for children to compare fractional amounts. For example, children can compare the amounts people would get if 2, 3, 4, and 6 people shared a brownie. <em>The Doorbell Rang</em> <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_443" >(Hutchins, 1986)</a> is a great children&#8217;s book that builds on the idea that as the number of sharers involved increases, the smaller the shares become. Encourage children to use the formal fraction names in their comparisons; for example, one-third of a brownie is less than one-half of a brownie.</p>
<p>Using a length model helps to emphasize that a fraction is a quantity and it also allows children to compare fractions in terms of relative size. The following activity (adapted from 
<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_211" >Bay-Williams &amp; Martinie, 2003</a>) is a fun way to use a real-world context to engage children in thinking about comparing fractions through a linear model.</p>

<p>Explain to the children that friends are playing the game &#8220;Red Light&#8211;Green Light.&#8221; The fractions tell how much of the distance each child has already moved. Who is winning? Challenge children to place the friends on a line to show where they are between the start and finish.</p>

<p>The game &#8220;Red Light&#8211;Green Light&#8221; may not be familiar to all children, especially ELLs. Modeling the game with children in the class is a good way to build background knowledge and also support children with disabilities.</p>
