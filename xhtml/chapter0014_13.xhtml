            <h2 class="title">Teaching Considerations for Fraction Concepts</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Because the teaching of fractions is so important, and because fractions are often not well understood even
            by adults, we revisit some of the more significant ideas offered in this chapter here. Hopefully you have
            recognized that one reason fractions are not well understood is that there is a lot to know about them, from
            part&#8211;whole relationships to division (fair sharing), and understanding includes being able to
            represent fractions across area, length, and set models and includes contexts that fit these models. Many of
            these ideas may not have been part of your own learning experience, but they must be part of your teaching
            experience so that your children can fully understand fractions and in the future be successful with
            fraction computation, algebra, and mathematics beyond.</p>
        <p><span id="page327" class="pagebreak" title="327" />The following research based recommendations for
            instruction provide an effective recap of the big ideas in this chapter (e.g., <a

        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p>Give a greater emphasis to the variety of meanings of fractions, moving children&#8217;s
                    understanding of fractions beyond part&#8211;whole.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Incorporate a variety of models and contexts to represent fractions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Emphasize that fractions are numbers, making use of measurement contexts and number lines in
                    representing fractions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Spend whatever time is needed for children to understand equivalences (concretely), including f
                    lexible naming of fractions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Iterating and partitioning must be a significant aspect of fraction instruction.</p>

            which provides a summary of common misconceptions and errors children make when they are learning about
            fraction concepts along with ways you can help them work through these issues.</p>
