<h2 class="title">The Meaning and Process of Measuring</h2></header>
<p>Suppose that you asked your children to measure an empty bucket (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_1">Figure 15.1</a>). The first thing they would need to know is <em>what</em> about the bucket is to be measured. They might measure the height, depth, diameter (distance across), or circumference (distance around). All of these are length measures. They could determine the surface area of the side as well as the volume (or capacity) and weight of the bucket. Each aspect that can be measured is an <em>attribute</em> of the bucket.</p>

<summary>Expand/collapse description</summary>
<p>The bucket is hung from a spring with a vertical rod parallel to the bucket, a string around the bucket and 3 balls with an arrow pointing into the bucket. Four rectangles each contain one attribute as follows: Attribute: Weight, Units: objects that stretch the spring in the scale. How many units will, pull, the spring as far as the bucket will? Attribute: Volume slash capacity. Units: cubes, balls, cups of water. How many units will, fill, the bucket? Attribute: Length. Units: rods, toothpicks, straws, string. How many units are, as tall as, the bucket? How much string is needed to, go around, the bucket? Attribute: Area Units: index cards, squares of paper, tiles How many cards will, cover, the surface of the bucket?</p></details>
<p>Once children determine the attribute to be measured, they then choose a unit that has the attribute being measured. Length is measured with units that have length, area with units that have area, volume with units that have volume, weight with units that have weight, and so on.</p>
<p><span id="page332" class="pagebreak" title="332" />Technically, a <em>measurement</em> is a number that indicates a comparison between the attribute of the object (or situation, or event) being measured and the same attribute of a given unit of measure. We commonly use small units of measure to determine a numeric relationship (the measurement) between what is measured and the unit. For example, to measure a length, the comparison can be done by lining up copies of the unit directly against the length being measured. For most attributes measured in schools, we can say that <em>to measure</em> means that the attribute being measured is &#8220;filled,&#8221; &#8220;covered,&#8221; or &#8220;matched&#8221; with a unit of measure having the same attribute (as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_1">Figure 15.1</a>).</p>
<p>In summary, to measure something, one must perform three steps:</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li><p>Decide on the attribute to be measured.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a unit that has that attribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the units&#8212;by filling, covering, matching, or using some other method&#8212;with the attribute of the object being measured. The number of units required to match the object is the measure.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Measuring instruments such as rulers, meter sticks, scales, and clocks are devices that make the filling, covering, or matching process easier. A ruler lines up the units of length and numbers them. A clock lines up units of time and marks them off.</p>

<h3 class="title">Measurement Concepts and Skills</h3>
</header>
<p>If a typical group of first graders attempts to measure the length of their classroom by laying strips 1 meter long end to end, the strips sometimes overlap, and the line can weave in a snakelike fashion. Do they understand the concept of length as an attribute of the classroom? Do they understand that each 1-meter strip has this attribute of length? They most likely understand that they are counting a line of strips stretching from wall to wall. But they may not be explicitly aware that, when measuring, they are comparing the same attribute of the measuring unit (the 1-meter strip) and the object being measured (the classroom). The skill of measuring with a unit must be explicitly linked to the concept of measuring as a process of comparing attributes. <a class="xref" href="#Tab_15_1">Table 15.1</a> describes an instructional sequence that can help explicitly link measurement concepts and skills. As the first step in the instructional sequence highlights, before anything can be measured meaningfully, it is necessary to understand the attribute to be measured <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_469" >(Battista, 2012)</a>.</p>

<h4 class="title">Making Comparisons</h4></header>
<p>With a measure, such as length, you can sometimes make a direct comparison by lining up one object against another. But often an indirect method using a third object must be used. For example, if children compare the height of a wastebasket to the distance around, they must devise an indirect way to compare, such as using a string to make that comparison. The string is the intermediary, as it is impossible to directly compare these two lengths.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch_15_teach01">
<header><h4 class="title" id="ch_15_teach01">Teaching Tip</h4></header>

<p>Use and encourage precise language when helping children make comparisons. Avoid using the ambiguous phrases &#8220;bigger than&#8221; and &#8220;smaller than&#8221;; instead use more specific language such as &#8220;longer than&#8221; or &#8220;is heavier than.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="title">Using Physical Models of Measuring Units</h4></header>
<p>For most attributes measured in elementary schools, it is possible to have physical models of units of measure. Time and temperature are exceptions. Units models can represent both nonstandard (sometimes referred to as <em>informal</em>) units and standard units. For length, for example, drinking straws (nonstandard) and 1-foot-long paper strips (standard) might be used as units.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="ch15-smp-01">
<header><h4 class="title" id="ch15-smp-01">Standards for Mathematical Practice</h4></header>
<p><strong>Attend to precision.</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>To help make the notion of units explicit, use as many copies of the unit as are needed to fill or match the attribute measured (this is called <em>tiling</em> and involves equal partitioning). The length of the room could be measured with giant footprints (nonstandard) by placing multiple copies of the footprint end to end, completely
&#8220;covering&#8221; the length of the room. Somewhat more difficult is using a single copy of the unit to complete the measurement (this is called <em>iteration.</em> You may recall that counting same-size fractional parts is also called <em>iteration</em>). That means measuring a given length (say, with a single footprint) by repeatedly moving it from position to position and keeping track of where the last unit ended. Not only is this more difficult for younger children, but it also obscures the meaning of the measurement&#8212;to see how many units will fill the length.</p>
<p>It is useful to measure the same object with units of different size to help children understand that the size of the unit used is important. (This is an expectation for second graders in the <em>Common Core State Standards</em>.) For each different-sized unit, estimate the measure in advance and discuss the estimate afterward. Children should start to observe that smaller units produce larger numeric measures, and vice versa. This is a difficult concept for young children to understand but they can make sense of it (e.g., <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_486" >National Research Council, 2009</a>). Children mentally construct this inverse relationship by estimating, then experimenting, and finally ref lecting on the measurements.</p>

<h4 class="title">Building and Using Measuring Instruments</h4>
</header>
<p>On the 2003 NAEP exam (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_470" >Blume, Galindo, &amp; Walcott, 2007</a>), only 20 percent of fourth graders could give the correct measure of an object not aligned with the end of a ruler, as in <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_2">Figure 15.2</a>. Even at the middle school level, only 56 percent of eighth graders answered the same situation accurately (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_479" >Kloosterman, Rutledge, &amp; Kenney, 2009</a>). Students on the same exam also experienced difficulty when the increments on a measuring tool were not one unit. These results point to the difference between using a measuring tool and understanding how it works.</p>

<img src="../images/Fig15-02.png" alt="A crayon under a ruler extends approximately from 2 to 8." /></figure>
<p>Only after children understand and can use single units of measurement should they move to working with common measuring tools. When children build simple measuring instruments using unit models with which they are familiar, it is more likely <span id="page334" class="pagebreak" title="334" />that they will understand how an instrument measures. A ruler is a good example. If children line up individual physical units, such as 1-inch-long paper clips or 1-inch-long tiles, along a strip of card stock and mark them off, they can see that it is the <em>spaces</em> on rulers and not the tick marks or numbers that are important. It is essential that children discuss how measurement with iterating individual units compares with measurement using an instrument. Without this comparison and discussion, children may not understand that these two methods are essentially the same. Then they are ready to compare their &#8220;ruler&#8221; with standard rulers and can compare their use.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="Teaching Tip 2">
<header><h4 class="title" id="ch_15_teach02">Teaching Tip</h4></header>

<p> If your children have been using individual paper clips as units of measurement, have them create a chain of paper clips to use as a ruler for an initial transition from single units to instruments.</p>
