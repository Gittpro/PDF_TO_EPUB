        </header>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest error in measurement instruction is the failure to recognize and separate two types of
            objectives: (1) understanding the meaning and technique of measuring a particular attribute and (2) learning
            about the standard units commonly used to measure that attribute.</p>

            </header>
            
            <p>As you teach standard units, make sure children, especially ELLs, understand the terms (e.g., feet, yard)
                and abbreviations (e.g., in, ft, cm). Include these on your math word wall.</p>
        </aside>

        <p>Teaching standard units of measure can be organized around three broad goals:</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p><em>Familiarity with the unit.</em> Children should have a basic idea of the size of commonly used
                    units and what they measure. Being able to estimate a shelf as 5 feet long is as important as being
                    able to measure the length of the shelf accurately.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Ability to select an appropriate unit.</em> Children should know both what is a reasonable unit
                    of measure in a given situation and the precision that is required. (Would you measure your lawn to
                    purchase grass seed with the same precision you would use to measure a window to buy a pane of
                    glass?) Children need practice in selecting appropriate standard units and judging the level of
                    precision.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Knowledge of relationships between units.</em> Children should know the relationships that are
                    commonly used, such as those between inches, feet, and yards or minutes and hours.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Children who exhibit measurement sense are familiar with the standard measurement units, are able to make
            estimates in terms of these units, and meaningfully interpret measures depicted with standard units.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Developing Unit Familiarity</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Two types of activities can develop familiarity with standard units: (1) comparisons that focus on a single
            unit and (2) activities that develop personal referents or benchmarks for single units or easy multiples of
            units.</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="Activity-15-1">

                <h4 class="title" id="Activity-15-1">Activity 15.1 About One Unit</h4>
            </header>
        
            <p><strong>CCSS-M: 1.MD.A.2; 2.MD.A.1; 2.MD.A.3</strong></p>
            <p>Give children a physical model of a standard unit and have them search for objects that have about the
                same measure as that one unit. For example, to develop familiarity with the meter, give children a piece
                of rope 1 meter long and challenge them find objects in the classroom, outside on the playground, around
                the school building, or at home that are about 1 meter in length (see <a
                        href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_About_a_Meter_PreK-2_NEW.pdf"
                        class="ulink">About a Meter</a> Activity Page). Have them make separate lists of things
                that are about 1 meter long, things that are a little shorter (or a little longer), or things that are
                twice as long (or half as long). Be sure to include curved or circular lengths. Later, children can try
                to predict whether a given object is longer, shorter, or close to 1 meter. (Notice the use of terms such
                as <em>longer</em> rather than <em>more than.</em> Remember to use precise language!)</p>
        </aside>
        <p>&#8220;About One Unit&#8221; can be done with other unit lengths. Enlist families to help children find
            familiar distances that are about 1 mile or 1 kilometer. Suggest in a take-home letter that families check
            the distances around the neighborhood, to the school or grocery store, or along other frequently traveled
            paths. If possible, send home (or use in class) a 1-meter or 1-yard trundle wheel to measure distances.

            using a trundle wheel to measure the length of the school hallway.</p>

            <p><span id="page336" class="pagebreak" title="336" />For other interesting locations to measure, go online
                to Google Earth and use their Measuring Tools. Children can measure distances in centimeters, inches,
                feet, yards, kilometers, and miles. If needed, watch a <strong>tutorial</strong> beforehand on how to
                measure distances on Google Earth (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYBoI7hZKss"
                        class="ulink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYBoI7hZKss</a>).</p>
        </aside>
        <p>For the standard weights of gram, kilogram, ounce, and pound, children can compare objects on a two-pan
            balance with single copies of these units in one pan and objects in the other. Note that one slice of
            store-bought sandwich bread usually weighs about 1 ounce, so many objects will weigh much more than 1 ounce.
            Children can be encouraged to bring in familiar objects from home to compare on the classroom scale.</p>

            <p>Meter trundle wheels measure off one meter with every rotation. Children may not understand that the
                circumference of the wheel is the same length as the flat meter stick. Help children make the connection
                by having them match a rope or strip of paper that is 1 meter in length to a meter stick and then to the
                wheel. You can also lay a meter stick down and roll the trundle wheel along the length of the stick.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>To develop unit familiarity, you can also begin with familiar items and use their measures as references or
            benchmarks. For example, a doorway is a bit more than 2 meters high. A bag of f lour is a good reference for
            5 pounds. A paper clip weighs about a gram and is about 1 centimeter wide. A gallon of milk weighs a little
            less than 4 kilograms. The next activity engages children in measuring familiar items in a variety of ways.

            <p>Read <em>Measuring Penny</em> (Leedy, 2000) to introduce children to the variety of ways familiar items
                can be measured. In this book, the author bridges between nonstandard units (e.g., dog biscuits, swabs,
                etc.) and standard units (inches, centimeters, etc.) to measure her pet dog Penny. Using the idea of
                measuring Penny for inspiration, have children find something at home (or in class) to measure in as
                many ways as they can think of using standard units. The measures should be rounded to the nearest whole
                numbers. Discuss in class the familiar items chosen and their measures so that different ideas and
                benchmarks are shared. Many of the units used in <em>Measuring Penny</em>
                are common in the United States but not in other countries. Still, the book can be used to relate to how
                children from other countries measure length and volume.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>There are other children&#8217;s books that can also engage children in developing familiarity with various
            lengths. For example, the children&#8217;s book <em>Actual Size</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_476"
                >Jenkins, 2011a</a>) portrays several different animals and insects (or a part
            of their body) in their actual size. From the head of a 23-foot-long crocodile to the hand of a gorilla to
            the 2.5-inch-tall mouse lemur, children can compare themselves and their classmates to these fascinating
            creatures while learning about linear measurement.</p>
        <p><span id="page337" class="pagebreak" title="337" />It can be interesting for children to find length
            benchmarks on their bodies. Have children compare their benchmarks with those of their parents or an older
            sibling to see how they differ in size. Point out that children will likely need to adjust their benchmarks
            over time as they grow.</p>

            <p>Measure various parts of your body. About how long is your foot, your stride, your hand span (stretched
                or with fingers together), the width of your index finger or pinky finger, your arm span (finger to
                finger and finger to nose), and the distance around your wrist and around your waist? What is the height
                to your waist, shoulder, and head? Some of these measures may prove to be useful benchmarks for single
                or multiples of standard units. (The average child&#8217;s fingernail is about 1 cm wide and most people
                can find a 10-cm length somewhere on their hands.)</p>

            <h4 class="title">Choosing Appropriate Units</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Should the room be measured in feet or inches? Should concrete blocks be weighed in grams or kilograms? The
            answers to questions such as these involve more than simply knowing how big the units are, although that is
            certainly required. Another consideration involves the need for precision. If you were measuring your wall
            in order to cut a piece of molding to fit, you would need to measure it very precisely. The smallest unit
            would be an inch or a centimeter, and you would also use small fractional parts. But if you were determining
            how many 8-foot molding strips to buy, the nearest foot would probably be sufficient.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Important Standard Units and Relationships</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Although a conceptual foundation for measuring many attributes is developed during grades preK&#8211;2, the
            primary emphasis with standard units is on linear measurements, both customary and metric. The <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_485" >National Council of Teachers of Mathematics
                (2011b)</a> takes a strong position on the metric system, because it is a globally used system and if
            U.S. students are going to be prepared for the global workplace, they must be knowledgeable about and
            comfortable with metric units. NCTM&#8217;s position statement goes on to say that because we are still
            using customary measures in day-to-day life children must <span id="page338" class="pagebreak"
                title="338" />work in that system as well. The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> specifically state
            that, by the end of second grade, children should be familiar with centimeters and meters as well as inches
            and feet.</p>
        <p>The relationships between units within either the metric or customary systems are conventions. As such,
            children must simply be told what the relationships are (e.g., 3 feet or 36 inches in a yard; 100 cm in a
            meter), and instructional experiences must be devised to reinforce them. Knowing basic relationships between
            units in a given measurement system becomes important in the intermediate grades as they work on conversions
            between units. At the primary level, being able to pace off 3 meters&#8212;unit familiarity&#8212;is more
            important than knowing how many cups in a quart or inches in a yard. However, by gaining familiarity with
            various units, some children may begin to automatically use these relationships in their work.</p>
