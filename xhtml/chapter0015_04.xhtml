        </header>
        <p>Measurement estimation is the process of using mental and visual information to measure or make comparisons
            without using measuring instruments. People use this practical skill almost every day. Do I have enough
            sugar to make cookies? Can you throw the ball 15 meters? Is this suitcase over the weight or size limit?
            Will my car fit into that parking space? Here are several reasons for including estimation in measurement
            activities:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Estimation helps children focus on the attribute being measured and the measuring process. Think how
                    you would estimate the area of the cover of this book using playing cards as the unit. To do so, you
                    have to think about what area is and how the units might be placed on the book cover.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Estimation provides an intrinsic motivation for measurement activities. It is interesting to see how
                    close you can come in your estimate to the actual measure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When standard units are used, estimation helps develop familiarity with the unit. If you estimate the
                    height of the door in meters before measuring, you must think about the size of a meter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The use of a benchmark to make an estimate lays the foundation for multiplicative reasoning. For
                    example, someone might reason that the width of a picture is about twice the length of a ruler, or 2
                    groups of 12 inches or 24 inches or 2 feet.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In all measuring activities, emphasize the use of approximate language. The desk is <em>about</em> 15 orange
            rods long. The chair is a <em>little less than</em> 4 straws high. Approximate language is very useful for
            young children because many measurements do not result in whole numbers. As children get older, they will
            begin to use fractional units or smaller units to measure with more precision. When this happens,
            acknowledge that the smaller unit or subdivision produces a greater degree of <em>precision</em>. This is
            also an opportunity to develop the idea that all measurements include some error. For example, a length that
            has been measured accurately can never be more than one-half unit in error. And because there is no
            &#8220;smallest unit,&#8221; there is always some error involved. In other words, all measurements are
            approximations.</p>

            <p>Why is it the case that a length that has been measured accurately can never be more than one-half unit

        <p><span id="page339" class="pagebreak" title="339" />Suppose that you are measuring a length of ribbon with a
            ruler that only shows quarter inches&#8212;so our unit is a quarter of an inch. If the length of ribbon
            falls between <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math339.png" alttext="3 3 over 4" altimg-height="35" altimg-width="28" class="informalequation">
<mn>3</mn><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math> and 4 inches, we would usually round to whichever number is closer to the length of
            ribbon. If the length of ribbon is more than halfway towards the 4-inch mark, we say it&#8217;s 4 inches
            long. However, if the length of ribbon is less than halfway from <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math339.png" alttext="3 3 over 4" altimg-height="35" altimg-width="28" class="informalequation">

            ignoring the difference&#8212;and this constitutes our &#8220;error.&#8221; If we need more precision in our
            measurement, we use smaller units to ensure that our measurement rounding or error is within an acceptable
            range.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Strategies for Estimating Measurements</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Always begin a measurement activity with children making an estimate&#8212;whether they are using nonstandard
            or standard units. Just as for computational estimation, specific strategies exist for estimating measures.
            Here are four specific strategies:</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p><em>Develop and use benchmarks or referents.</em> Research suggests that children who acquire mental
                    benchmarks or reference points for measurements <em>and</em> practice using them in class activities
                    are much better estimators than children who have not learned to use benchmarks (<a
                        class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_478" >Joram, 2003</a>). Children must pay
                    attention to the size of the unit to estimate well (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_490"
                        >Towers &amp; Hunter, 2010</a>). Referents should be things that are
                    easily envisioned by the child. One example is the height of an average child (see <a class="xref"
                        href="#fig_15_3">Figure 15.3</a>). Children should have a good referent for single units and
                    also useful multiples of standard units.</p>

                <details id="longdesc_la_ch15-03">
                    <summary>Expand/collapse description</summary>
                    <p>Estimate the room length. Use: windows, bulletin board, and spaces between as chunks. Use: mental
                        benchmark, my height is about 4 feet long. I could get 5 kids lying down in here plus maybe 3
                        more feet. Say, 23 feet. A room length is divided by 5 double ended arrows, one extends the
                        distance from a wall the length of a bulletin board, to 3 arrows, end to end each the length of
                        windows, and the last arrow extending from the window to the further wall. Five outlines of a
                        person are on the floor one above each other from one wall toward the opposite wall but do not
                        meet the farther wall. </p>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Use &#8220;chunking&#8221; or subdivisions.</em> The weight of a stack of books is easier to
                    estimate if some referent is given to the weight of an &#8220;average&#8221; book. If a wall length
                    to be estimated has useful chunks that can be used, it is usually easier to estimate the shorter
                    chunks along the wall than to estimate the whole length. <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_3">Figure
                        15.3</a> shows an example using windows, bulletin boards, and spaces between as chunks.
                    Alternatively, if the wall length to be estimated has no useful chunks, it can be mentally divided
                    in half and then in fourths or even eighths by repeatedly subdividing it until a more manageable
                    length is found. Length, volume, and area measurements all lend themselves to chunking or
                    subdividing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span id="page340" class="pagebreak" title="340" /><em>Iterate units.</em> For length, area, and
                    volume, it is sometimes easy to mark off single units mentally or physically. You might use your
                    hands or make marks or folds to keep track as you go. If a child knows, for example, that her stride
                    is about one-half of a meter long, she can walk off a length and then add to get an estimate. Hand
                    and finger widths are useful for shorter measures.</p>

        </aside>
        <p>Each strategy just listed should be explicitly taught and discussed with children. Suggested benchmarks for
            useful measures can be developed and recorded on a class chart. Include items found at home. But the best
            approach to improving estimation skills is to have children do a lot of estimating. Keep these teaching tips
            in mind:</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p><em>Help children learn strategies by having them first try a specified approach.</em> Later
                    activities should permit them to choose whatever techniques they wish.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Discuss how different children made their estimates.</em> This will confirm that there is no
                    single right way to estimate while reminding children of other useful approaches.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Accept a range of estimates.</em> Think in relative terms about what is a good estimate. Within
                    10 percent for length is quite good. Even 30 percent &#8220;off&#8221; may be reasonable for weights
                    or volumes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Do not promote a &#8220;winning&#8221; estimate.</em> This discourages estimation and promotes
                    only seeking the exact answer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Encourage children to give a range of estimates that they believe includes the actual
                        measure.</em> For example, the door is between 7 and 8 feet tall. This not only is a practical
                    approach in real life but also helps focus on the approximate nature of estimation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Make measurement estimation an ongoing activity.</em> Post a daily measurement to be estimated.
                    Children can record their estimates and discuss them in a 5-minute period. Teams of second graders
                    can take turns determining the daily measurements to estimate each week.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Be precise with your language.</em> Do not use the word <em>measure</em> interchangeably with the
                    word <em>estimate</em> <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_490" >(Towers &amp;
                        Hunter, 2010)</a>. Randomly substituting one word for the other will cause uncertainty and
                    possibly confusion in children.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Estimation activities need not be elaborate. Any measurement activity can have an
            &#8220;estimate first&#8221; component. For more emphasis on the process of estimation itself, simply think
            of measures that can be estimated and have children estimate. Here are two suggestions.</p>

                principal! Each day, select a different attribute or dimension to estimate. For the pumpkin, for
                example, children can estimate its height, circumference, weight, and volume. Remember you can use
                nonstandard units to give children practice measuring various attributes until they are ready for
                standard units. If you have ELLs, be sure to include metric measures when you have moved to standard
                units. You can also help children compare the centimeter to the inch. Watch this short
