<h2 class="title">Length</h2></header>
<p>Length is usually the first attribute children learn to measure. Length of an object is found by locating two endpoints and examining how far it is between those points. We measure lengths by selecting a unit (that has length) and repeatedly matching that unit to the object.</p>
<p>Be aware, however, that length measurement is not immediately understood by young children. Here are some of the more common misconceptions and difficulties children have when measuring length (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_473" >Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_474" >Curry, Mitchelmore, &amp; Outhred, 2006</a>):</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Leaving gaps between units or overlapping units</p></li>
<li><p>Using units that are not of equal size (e.g., measuring with paper clips of different sizes)</p></li>
<li><p>Combining units of different sizes as if they were the same unit (e.g., combining 2 feet and 4 inches as &#8220;6 long&#8221;)</p></li>
<li><p>Measuring from the wrong end of the ruler or beginning at &#8220;1&#8221; rather than &#8220;0&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Counting the tick marks on a ruler or the &#8220;points&#8221; between heel-to-toe steps rather than the spaces (units)</p></li>
<li><p>Not aligning two objects when comparing them</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keep these misconceptions and difficulties in mind as you plan lessons and observe your children during measurement activities.</p>

<h3 class="title">Comparison Activities</h3>
</header>
<p>At the preK and kindergarten level, children should begin with direct comparisons of two or more lengths and then move to indirect comparisons by the first grade (<a href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" class="noteref_biblioref">CCSSO, 2010;</a> <span id="page342" class="pagebreak" title="342" /><span id="z13-6"><a href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_483" class="noteref_biblioref">NCTM, 2006</a>). Throughout the school day, look for opportunities for children to compare lengths directly. For example, which block tower is taller, which clay snake is shorter, which chair is wider, and so on. The next two activities offer direct comparison experiences. </span></p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: K.MD.A.2; 1.MD.A.1; 2.MD.A.3</strong></p>
<p>Create learning stations where children can explore which objects in a group are longer, shorter, or about the same in length as a specified &#8220;target&#8221; object. Change the target object and children may find that the shorter object is now longer than the target. A similar task can involve putting a set of objects in order from shortest to longest.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: K.MD.A.2; 1.MD.A.1; 1.MD.A.2; 2.MD.A.3</strong></p>
<p>Give pairs of children a strip of card stock, a stick, a length of rope, or some other object with an obvious length dimension that will serve as a &#8220;target&#8221; unit. The task is for children to find five things in the room that are shorter than, longer than, or about the same length as their target unit. They can record what they find in pictures or words.</p>
<p>By making the target length a standard unit (e.g., a meter stick or a 1-meter length of rope), the activity can be repeated to provide familiarity with important standard units.</p>
</aside>
<p>Indirect comparison, which means using another object to help make the measure, is the focus of the next activity. Children who can use a third object to compare the lengths of two other objects must have a transitive understanding of measurement. For example, if the length of a green pencil is shorter than the length of a blue pencil, and the length of the blue pencil is shorter than the length of a red pencil, then the length of the green pencil must be shorter than the length of the red pencil. Not all children in grades K&#8211;1 will be able to follow this argument (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_474" >Curry, Mitchelmore, &amp; Outhred, 2006</a>); however, through indirect comparison activities, they can begin to build this understanding.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: 1.MD.A.1; 2.MD.A.3; 2.MD.A.4</strong></p>
<p>Challenge children to determine whether an object in the classroom or outside the classroom (maybe in the library or cafeteria or on the playground) would fit through the doorway of the classroom. For example, ask, &#8220;Is the classroom doorway wide enough for one of the tables in the cafeteria to go through?&#8221; or &#8220;Will one of the shelves in the library fit through the doorway?&#8221; or &#8220;What about the monkey bars on the playground?
Will those fit through the school&#8217;s front door?&#8221; Have pairs of children brainstorm ways they can check and then discuss and try some of their suggestions.</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page343" class="pagebreak" title="343" />Children should also compare lengths that are not in straight lines. One way to do this is by using indirect comparisons.</p>

<p>Make some crooked or curvy paths on the floor (or outside) with masking tape or chalk. Ask children to determine which path is longest, next longest, and so on. (Some children may focus on the straight-line distance from the</p>
<p>beginning of the curved path to its end [<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_469" >Battista, 2012</a>]. So make sure to emphasize that the length you want them to consider is along the curved path.) Children should suggest ways to measure the crooked paths so that they can be compared easily. If you wish to offer a hint, provide pairs of children with a long piece of string (at first make it longer than the path). Have children explain how they solved the problem. For children with disabilities, you may need to tape the end of the string to the beginning of the path and help them mark the final measurement on the string with a marker. Use another string in the same way for the other path. Then compare the string lengths.</p>
<p>Some children may argue that the path that &#8220;looks longer&#8221; (i.e., is more spread out) is the longer path, when the crooked and more compact path may actually be longer. For these children, show them an example of two paths on the floor (one really crooked, compact path and one straight path that &#8220;looks longer&#8221; than the crooked path) and have children walk each path to see which takes longer to walk. See the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/Expanded_Lesson_Crooked_Paths.pdf" class="ulink">Expanded Lesson: Crooked Paths</a> for an enhanced version of this activity.</p>
