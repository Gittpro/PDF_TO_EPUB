            <h3 class="title">Using Physical Models of Length Units</h3>
        </header>
        <p>There are four important principles of iterating units of length, whether they are nonstandard or standard
            (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_471" >Dietiker, Gonulates, Figueras, &amp; Smith,
                2010</a>, p. 2). You will notice that these principles are related to some of the common difficulties
            children have with linear measurement that were identified earlier.</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Units must have equal length; otherwise you cannot iterate them to obtain a count.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Units must be aligned with the length being measured; otherwise a different quantity is being
                    measured.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Units must be placed without gaps, or a part of the length is not being measured.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Units must be placed without overlaps, or the length has portions that are measured more than once.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Children can begin to measure length using a variety of nonstandard units, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p><em>Giant footprints.</em> Cut out about 20 copies of a large footprint about 1&#189; to 2 feet long
                    on poster board.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Measuring ropes.</em> Cut rope into lengths of 1 meter. These ropes can measure the perimeter and
                    the circumference of objects such as the teacher&#8217;s desk, a tree trunk, or the class pumpkin.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Drinking straws.</em> Straws are useful in that they are easily cut into smaller units. They can
                    also be linked together with a long string or slid onto a length of pipe cleaner, creating an
                    excellent bridge to a ruler or measuring tape.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Shorter units.</em> Flat toothpicks, linking cubes and paper clips are useful nonstandard units
                    for measuring shorter lengths. Cuisenaire rods are also useful because they are easily <span
                        id="page344" class="pagebreak" title="344" /><span id="z15-6">placed end to end and are also
                        metric (centimeters). Paper clips can also be made into chains, again making an excellent bridge
                        to a ruler. Note that individual linking cubes do not explicitly exhibit the attribute of length
                        as well as Cuisenaire rods, toothpicks, paper clips, and straws. </span></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that using a few well-chosen nonstandard units can avoid confusing children with too many kinds
            of units. Once children demonstrate, in particular, that all the units used to measure a given length must
            be the same length, then you may want to increase the variety of nonstandard units available.</p>
        <p>The following activity encourages children to develop their own approach to measuring lengths.</p>

            <p>Explain that you have just received an important request from the principal. She needs to know exactly
                how tall each teacher in the building is. The children are to decide how to measure the teachers and
                write a note to the principal explaining how tall their teacher is and detailing the process that they
                used. If you wish to give a hint, ask, &#8220;Would it help if I lie down?&#8221; Have children make
                marks at your feet and head and draw a straight line between these marks.</p>
            <p>Explain that the principal says they can use any nonstandard or standard unit to measure with (provide
                choices). For each choice of unit, supply enough units to more than cover your length. Put children in
                pairs and allow them to select one unit with which to measure. Ask children to estimate first and then
                use their unit to measure. For those ready for a challenge, have them do the measurement twice, with two
                different units.</p>
            <p>Follow up with questions such as &#8220;What did you do to get your measurement?&#8221; &#8220;Did
                children who measured with the same unit get the same answers? If not, why not?&#8221; &#8220;How could
                the principal make a line that was as long as the teacher?&#8221; Focus on the value of carefully lining
                up units end to end. Discuss what happens if you overlap units, have gaps in the units, or don&#8217;t
                follow a straight line.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>You can repeat the basic task of &#8220;How Long Is the Teacher?&#8221; by measuring a variety of items. It
            is helpful when several pairs of children use the same unit to measure the target lengths (e.g., heights,
            distances around) so that possible errors can be discussed and the measuring process refined.</p>
        <p>The following measurement activity adds an explicit estimation component.</p>

            <p>Make lists of things in the room to measure (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_4">Figure 15.4</a>) or use
                the <a

                        class="ulink">Estimating and Measuring with Nonstandard Units Recording Sheet</a>. Run
                a piece of masking tape along the dimension of the objects to be measured. Include curves or other
                distances that are not straight lines. Have children make estimates before they measure. Young children
                and children with disabilities may find it difficult to come up with a reasonable estimate, so provide
                possible strategies. For example, make a row or chain of exactly 10 of the units to help them visualize
                their estimates. They first lay 10 units against the object and then make their estimate. You can also
                do this activity using standard units.</p>
