The <em>Common Core State Standards</em> recommend that second graders consider the relationship between the size of a unit and the resulting measure. Children can find it a challenge to understand that larger units will create a smaller measure and vice versa. Engage children in activities in which this issue is emphasized.</p>

<p>Have children measure a length with a specified unit. Then provide them with a different unit that is either twice as long or half as long as the original unit. Their task is to predict the measure of the same length using the new unit. Children should write down their predictions and discuss how they made their estimations. Provide the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Changing_Units_Recording_Sheet_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Changing Units Recording Sheet</a>. Cuisenaire rods are excellent for this activity. Challenge ready children with units that are more difficult multiples of the original unit.</p>

<p><span id="page346" class="pagebreak" title="346" />When first doing the &#8220;Changing Units&#8221; activity, show the second unit and discuss only if the measure will be smaller or larger using this unit. You will find that many children will think that the larger units will give the larger measure. Allow children to struggle with their reasoning and test their conjectures by actually measuring.</p>

<p> Start with simpler multiples (e.g., halving and doubling) so children will more easily be able to unpack the inverse relationship of size of unit to the numeric measure.</p>

<p>Observation and discussion during activities such as those just described provide evidence of how well your children understand length measurement. Additional tasks that can be used as assessments in a diagnostic interview format are:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Ask children to draw a line or mark off a distance of a prescribed number of units. 	Observe whether children know to align the units in a straight line without overlaps or gaps.</p></li>
<li><p>Show children objects that have been aligned with Cuisnaire rods, as shown below. 	Ask, &#8220;What is the length of each object?&#8221; Do they simply count the &#8220;units&#8221;? Do they indicate there is a problem with the different length units in the second example?
</p></li>
</ul>

<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Alternatively, provide a box with assorted units of different sizes, such as Cuisenaire rods. Have children use the materials in the box to measure a given length. Observe whether the child understands that all units must be of similar size. If different lengths of units are used, ask the child to describe his or her measurement.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate to the class how a fictitious child used a ruler to measure the length of an object. Make many errors such as showing gaps, overlaps, and a wavy line of alignment in the placement of the ruler. The children&#8217;s task is to explain why these measurements may be inaccurate.</p></li>
<li><p>Have children measure two different objects. Then ask how much longer the longer object is. Observe whether children can use the two measurements they have to answer or whether they need to make a third measurement to find the difference.</p></li>
<li><p>Have children measure a length with small paper clips and then again with large paper clips. Can they identify and describe the inverse relationship between the measures they find and the size of the units?</p></li>

<p><strong>3 Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.</strong></p>
</aside>
<p>If your assessment indicates that there is some confusion about how length is measured, use the class discussion of these results to help your children self-assess and refine their understanding.</p>
