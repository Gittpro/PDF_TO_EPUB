<h3 class="title">Making and Using Rulers</h3>
</header>
<p><span id="page347" class="pagebreak" title="347" />The jump from measuring with actual units to using standard rulers is challenging. One method to help children understand rulers is to have them make their own rulers.</p>

<p>Alternatively, children can color a strip of grid paper and number each section to create their own ruler. For example, you can use centimeter grid paper to create a metric ruler.</p>

<p>Use two colors of precut narrow strips of construction paper for the units. Each unit should have a length that is at least twice as long as the width so that the notion of length is emphasized. For example, if you use inches as the unit, your narrow strips could be 1 inch long and <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math347.png" alttext="1 half" altimg-height="35" altimg-width="18" class="informalequation">
<mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math> inch wide (or tall). Or you could use a nonstandard unit of 5 cm long and about <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math347_1.png" alttext="2 1 half" altimg-height="35" altimg-width="28" class="informalequation">
<mn>2</mn><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math> cm wide. Discuss how the units could be used to measure a length by laying them end to end. Provide long strips of card stock at least twice the width of your unit. Have children make their own ruler by gluing the units in alternating colors onto the card stock, as shown at the top of <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_5">Figure 15.5</a>.</p>
<p>Have children use their new rulers to measure items on a list you provide. Include items that are longer than their rulers. Discuss the results, including how they measured the longer items. There might be discrepancies due to rulers that were not made properly or because a child does not understand how a ruler works.</p>
<p>Also, consider using larger nonstandard units such as multiple tracings of a child&#8217;s footprint glued onto strips of cash register tape (without gaps or overlaps). These rulers can be used to measure longer lengths or distances.</p>
</aside>
<p>Challenge children to find more than one way to measure a length with a ruler. Do you have to start at the end? What if you start at another unit in the center? Does that matter? Children can eventually put numbers on their handmade rulers, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_5">Figure 15.5</a>. To begin with, numbers can be written in the center of each unit as a way to precount the units. When numbers are written in the standard way, at the ends of the units, the ruler becomes a number line. This format is more sophisticated and should be carefully discussed with children&#8212;in particular, why the numbers are at the end of the unit. (See the discussion in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> about meaningfully developing a number line representation with children. Look for opportunities to help children relate the number-line representation to length measurement.)</p>

<p>A set of squares of alternating colors are glued to a card stock strip. Numbers 1 to 10 are written, one on each square. Numbers help count the units. A ruler is shown with intervals of 1 unit from 0 to 10. Standard rulers: numbers are at ends of units. Notice where 0 is.<span id="page348" class="pagebreak" title="348" /></p></details>
<p>Be explicit in making the connection between the handmade rulers and standard rulers. Give children a standard ruler and have them identify and discuss how the rulers they have made and standard rulers are alike and how they are different. Ask questions such as &#8220;What are the units?&#8221; &#8220;What do the numbers mean?&#8221; &#8220;What are the other marks for?&#8221; &#8220;Where do the units begin?&#8221; &#8220;Could you make a ruler with the same units as the standard ruler?&#8221;</p>

<p>Research indicates that when children see standard rulers with the numbers on the tick marks, they often incorrectly believe that the numbers are counting the marks rather than indicating the units or spaces between the marks. This is a misconception about rulers that can lead to wrong answers. As a performance assessment, provide children with a ruler, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_6">Figure 15.6</a>, with tick marks but no numbers. Have children use the ruler to measure an item that is shorter than the ruler. Use an <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM33_Observation_Checklist.pdf" class="ulink">Observation Checklist</a> (Blackline Master 33) to record whether children count spaces between the tick marks or count the tick marks.</p>
<p>Another good performance assessment of ruler understanding is to have children measure with a &#8220;broken&#8221; ruler, one with the first two units broken off. Use your <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM33_Observation_Checklist.pdf" class="ulink">Observation Checklist</a> to note whether children say that it is impossible to measure with such a ruler because there is no starting point. Also note on your checklist those who match and count the units meaningfully in their measures, indicating understanding.</p>
<p>Observing how children use a ruler to measure an object that is longer than the ruler is also informative. If a child simply reads the last mark on the ruler, this is an indication that he or she does not understand how a ruler is a representation of a continuous row of units.</p>

<p>GeoGebra offers a couple of interactive applets in which children are asked to measure given objects using a broken ruler (search for &#8220;GeoGebra broken rulers&#8221;). The interactive applet allows you to change the ruler from a standard ruler to a standard ruler that is broken along different intervals. There are nine objects children can measure, all of which are close enough in length to approximate to whole units. The rulers on this worksheet are all divided into fourths. Maine&#8217;s Education Development Center also provides an interactive applet that uses a ruler that is divided into sixteenths to measure various parts of pets (search for &#8220;Maine EDC broken rulers&#8221;). If children click on the hint button, a line is drawn along the path that should be measured.</p>
