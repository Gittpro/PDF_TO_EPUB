            <h3 class="title">Reading Clocks</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The common instrument for measuring time is the clock. However, learning to tell time has little to do with
            time measurement and more to do with the skills of learning to read an instrument. Clock reading can be a
            difficult skill to teach. Starting in first grade, children are usually taught to read clocks to the hour
            and then to the half hour. In second grade, they learn to read to 5-minute intervals <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" >(CCSSO, 2010)</a>. In the early stages of
            this sequence, children are shown clocks set exactly to the hour or half hour. Thus, many children who can
            read a clock at 7:00 or 2:30
            are initially challenged by 6:58 or 2:33.</p>
        <p>Digital clocks permit children to read times easily but do not relate times very well to benchmark times. To
            know that a digital reading of 7:58 is nearly 8:00, the child must know that there are 60 minutes in an
            hour, that 58 is close to 60, and that 2 minutes is not a very long time. The analog clock shows
            &#8220;close to&#8221; times visually without the need for understanding large numbers or even how many
            minutes are in an hour.</p>
        <p>The following suggestions can help children understand and read analog clocks by focusing on the actions and
            functions of the minute and hour hands.</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p>Discuss what happens to the big hand as the little hand goes from one hour to the next. When the big
                    hand is at 12, the hour hand is pointing exactly at a number. If the hour hand <span id="page350"
                        class="pagebreak" title="350" />is about halfway between numbers, about where would the minute
                    hand be? If the hour hand is a little past or before an hour (10 to 15 minutes), where would the
                    minute hand be?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Move to working with a one-handed clock by removing the minute hand from a regular clock. Use lots of
                    approximate language: &#8220;It&#8217;s about 7 o&#8217;clock.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a little
                    past 9 o&#8217;clock.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s halfway between 2 o&#8217;clock and 3
                    o&#8217;clock&#8221; (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_15_7">Figure 15.7</a>).</p>

                    <p>Three clocks each with one hand are used to estimate time. The first clock has a hand pointing at
                        7, about 7 o'clock. The second clock has a hand just above the 9, between 9 and 10, A little bit
                        past 9 o'clock. The third clock has a hand between 2 and 3, halfway between 2 o'clock and 3
                        o'clock.</p>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use two clocks, one with only an hour hand and one with two hands. Cover the two-handed clock.
                    Periodically during the day, direct attention to the one-handed clock. Have children predict where
                    the minute hand will be. Uncover the other clock and discuss.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After step 3 has begun, teach 5-minute intervals by counting by fives going around the clock (grade 2
                    CCSS-M). Instead of saying that the minute hand is &#8220;pointing at the 4,&#8221; transition to
                    the language &#8220;it is about 20 minutes after the hour.&#8221; As skills develop, suggest that
                    children always look first at the hour hand to learn approximately what time it is and then focus on
                    the minute hand for precision.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Predict the reading on a digital clock when shown an analog clock, and set an analog clock when shown
                    a digital clock.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Relate the time after the hour to the time before the next hour. This is helpful not only for telling
                    time but also for number sense.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Finally, discuss the concept of A.M. and P.M.</p>

                        class="ulink">Clock Faces</a> (Blackline Master 31) by drawing an hour hand on each.
                Include placements that are approximately half past the hour, a quarter past the hour, a quarter until
                the hour, and some that are close to but not on the hour. For each clock face, the children&#8217;s task
                is to write the digital time and draw the corresponding minute hand on the clock. If you have ELLs, note
                that telling time is done differently in different cultures. For example, in the Spanish language any
                time past 30 minutes is stated as the next hour minus the time until that hour. For example, 10:45 is
                thought of as 15 minutes before 11, or 11 minus a quarter. Be explicit that in English it can be said
                either way&#8212;&#8220;10:45&#8221; or &#8220;a quarter till 11.&#8221;</p>

                Manipulatives allows children to change the time on an analog clock and see how it changes on the
                digital clock and vice versa. The &#8220;Time&#8212;Match Clocks&#8221; applet at the same website
                displays a time on the analog clock and children match that time on the digital clock. Times are also
                shown on the digital clock that children match using the analog clock.</p>

            activity not only motivates them to think about telling time, but it also helps them to consider the
            relationship between analog clock reading and digital recording.</p>

                the hour, half hour, or minute. When the bell rings, children should look up and record the time on the
                clock face and in numerals on the recording sheet. Although elapsed time is a third-grade topic in the
                <em>Common Core State Standards,</em> this activity provides opportunities for children to discuss the
                time between timer rings.</p>
