            <h3 class="title">Counting Sets of Coins</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Naming the total value of a group of coins is the same as mentally adding their values. Second graders can be
            asked to do the mental mathematics required in counting a collection of different coins. Watch this video of
            an interview with <a href="https://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/0142_iPad"
                    class="ulink">Edgar</a> who is thinking about a story problem involving money. Should the
            teacher ask other questions that link the amounts <span id="page352" class="pagebreak" title="352" />to the
            money, such as, &#8220;What is 100 cents also equal to?&#8221; in an effort to get the child to use money
            denominations such as one dollar or four quarters? Why is that f lexibility important?</p>
        <p>Children may sort their coins by value and start counting from the highest values, just as they often add or
            subtract the larger place values first. Or they may put coins together to make decade numbers, for example,
            adding a quarter and a nickel to make 30&#162;. With pennies aside, coins have the advantage of being in
            multiples of 5 and 10 and thereby lead to skip counting. The next activity helps prepare children for
            counting money.</p>

            <p>Explain to children that they will start skip counting by one number, and at your signal they will shift
                to a count by a different number. Use any two of these numbers:
                100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 1. Say, you begin with 25 and 10, and write them on the board. Point to the larger
                number (25), and have children begin to skip count from that number. (Always start with the larger
                number.) After three or more counts, raise your hand to indicate a pause in the counting. Then point to
                the smaller number (10). Children continue the skip count from where they left off but now count by
                tens. If you have ELLs who are recent immigrants, invite them to share coins from their country and see
                how they compare to our coins. Children with disabilities may need to use a hundreds chart to help them
                with their skip counts.</p>

            <p>When a collection of coins is not arranged in descending order of values, children must first sort the
                collection. This is a skill based only on the ability to compare numbers and recognize the value of the
                coins. Check to see if children can put a string of numbers such as this in order from greatest to
                least: 5, 1, 5, 25, 10, 1, 25, 10. For a child experiencing difficulty with this task, try a collection
                with no duplicates. If there is still difficulty, the child may need more experiences with counting, the
                hundreds chart, and other concept-development activities for number sense and place value.</p>
            <p>If the child can put the numeral string in order but cannot order a set of coins, the problem is most
                likely that the child has not learned the values of the coins.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Working with coins requires not only adding up the values but also first mentally giving each coin a value.
            Engage children in working with coins and developing addition concepts by having them add a mixed collection
            of coins.</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="Activity-15-18">
            <header>
                <h2 class="title" id="Activity-15-18">Activity 15.18 Coin-Number Addition</h2>
            </header>
            <figure class="figure_wrap">
                <img alt="" role="presentation" src="../images/activity.png"></img>

            <p><strong>CCSS-M: 2.MD.C.8</strong></p>
            <p>Show a small collection of coins not arranged in any order. Begin with only dimes and pennies. Then add
                some nickels and eventually quarters. Give children time to identify the coins and write down the
                corresponding numeric values of the coins (e.g., 5 for a nickel, 25 for a quarter). Have children share
                what they have written down to make sure everyone has identified the correct amounts.</p>
            <p><span id="page353" class="pagebreak" title="353" />Now the children&#8217;s task is to add the numbers
                mentally. Do not suggest how they add the numbers or in what order because there is almost always more
                than one good way to do this. For example, rather than add from the largest values to the
                smallest&#8212;the typical way coins are taught in books&#8212;it is also reasonable to use the 5s to
                make tens or other methods. For this collection, note that it is easy to add 5 and 25, then 10, then 7
                (the last 5 and two 1s). Discuss with children how they add each collection.</p>

        <p>You can also pose story problems about money using the problem structures for addition and subtraction
            discussed in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>. Consider the following examples:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="sidenote_ch15-1">
            <ul class="bulleted">
                <li>
                    <p>Alexis has some coins. John gives her 1 dime and 2 pennies. Now Alexis has 36&#162;. What coins
                        did Alexis have to begin with? (Joining: Start Unknown)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Jay has 2 quarters and a dime. He needs 95&#162; to buy a notebook. How much more money does Jay
                        need? (Part&#8211;Part&#8211;Whole: Part Unknown)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Andy has $11.65. He gave Kevin some money. Now Andy has $8.15. How much money did Andy give
                        Kevin? (Separate: Change Unknown)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Wendy has $2.67. That is $1.25 more than what Keith has. How much money does Keith have?
                        (Comparison: Smaller Unknown)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <p>As discussed in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, changing the numbers and the
            location of the unknown will modify the level of difficulty.</p>
