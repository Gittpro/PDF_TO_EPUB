<h3 class="title">Making Change</h3>
</header>
<p>When you pay for something at a store using cash, you may give the clerk more money than the purchase price and expect to receive change back. Knowing how to make change is important for the clerk but also for the customers&#8212;so they can check to make sure they received the correct change!</p>

<p>Before reading further, think about how you would make change from a hundred dollar bill for a purchase that cost $82.</p>
</aside>
<p>You may have thought, I can start at 100, go back 10 to 90, then back 8 more to 82&#8212;so the change would be <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math353.png" alttext="10 plus 8" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="47" class="informalequation">
<mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>8</mn></math> or 18 dollars. You could also start at 100, go back 20
to 80, up 2 to 82, so that&#8217;s <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math353_1.png" alttext="20 minus 2" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="47" class="informalequation">
<mn>20</mn><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></math> or 18. Or you may have thought to start at 82, go 8 more to 90 and then 10 more to 100&#8212;that&#8217;s <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math353_2.png" alttext="8 plus 10" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="47" class="informalequation">

<p>When introducing children to the process of making change, start with smaller values and connect the dime to the ten-frame.</p>
</aside>
<p>Making change is the same as finding a difference&#8212;specifically, a difference between the amount given to the clerk and the purchase price. We discussed a variety of strategies to find a difference in <a class="xref" href="chapter0009_00.xhtml">Chapters 9</a> and <a class="xref" href="chapter0012_00.xhtml">12</a>. One of those strategies, adding on or &#8220;think-addition,&#8221; was used in the third strategy just described. Because making change is related to strategies based on number sense, children should have experiences with these strategies before they are asked to make change with money.</p>
<p><span id="page354" class="pagebreak" title="354" />The following activity builds from children&#8217;s experiences using various strategies to find a difference.</p>

<p>Write a target number on the board that is an amount of money that might be given to a store clerk for a purchase, most likely 25, 50, 75, or 100. To the left of this target, write a smaller starting number (the purchase price) and an arrow. Here are some examples:</p>
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" altimg="../images/math354.png" alttext="13 rightwards arrow 25 space space 56 rightwards arrow 75 space space 29 rightwards arrow 50" altimg-height="13" altimg-width="196" class="informalequation">
<mn>13</mn><mo>&#x2192;</mo><mn>25</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>56</mn><mo>&#x2192;</mo><mn>75</mn><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mo>&#xA0;</mo><mn>29</mn><mo>&#x2192;</mo><mn>50</mn></math>

<p>In creating the amounts for this activity, think in terms of purchases. If the target is 75, that means you gave the clerk 75&#162;. You would only do this for items costing more than 50&#162;. Similarly, for a target of 50, use numbers greater than 25. For a target of 100, any smaller number would be appropriate because you may have given the clerk a dollar bill.</p>
<p>Embed the numbers in story problems that describe making a purchase. Explain to the children that the first number written represents the amount of the purchase and the second number represents the amount of money given to the store clerk. The children&#8217;s task is to find the difference (i.e., the change) using a strategy that they can explain. They may need to write down intermediate results. Discuss the solution methods used by different children.</p>
<p>When your children are ready, extend to target values greater than a dollar.</p>
</aside>
<p>The next activity extends &#8220;How Much Is the Change?&#8221; and attempts to draw children&#8217;s attention to the notion of using the fewest possible coins.</p>

<p>On the board, write start and target numbers as in &#8220;How Much Is the Change?&#8221; Then write on the board the values of the coins: 25, 10, 5, 1. Children must use only the numbers (i.e., coins) in the list to create the difference. As they use a number, they should write it down. Challenge children to try to use as few &#8220;coins&#8221; as possible or, in other words, as many of the larger numbers as possible. For example, if the target is 75 with a start of 58, they would write 1, 1, 10, 5. Have children discuss their solutions.</p>

<p>The Coin Box applet found at Illuminations on NCTM&#8217;s website poses tasks that allow children to count coins, collect a given amount of money, exchange a given collection of coins for the fewest coins, and make change. There are two options to display coins&#8212;one that uses only the pictures of coins and another that places the coin onto a grid that indicates its value (e.g., a nickel is displayed on a 1 by 5 grid; a dime is displayed on a 2 by 5 grid). The National Library of Virtual Manipulatives applet called &#8220;Money&#8221; uses coins and bills. Children can count the money displayed, pay an exact amount, and make a dollar by dragging coins into a box. These applets are good tasks for math centers where children can practice skills related to counting money.</p>
