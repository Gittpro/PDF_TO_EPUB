        <p>Although children in grades preK&#8211;2 focus on measuring length, time, and money, they also need to engage
            in informal explorations with other measureable attributes, such as area, volume, and weight to prepare them
            for the more formal study of measuring these attributes that begins in third grade <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" >(CCSSO, 2010)</a>. Here we offer some ideas
            and activities for initial experiences with area, volume, and weight.</p>
        <header id="chap15-head3_14">
            <h3 class="title">Area</h3>
        </header>
        <p><em>Area</em> is the measure of two-dimensional space inside a region. As with other attributes, children
            must first understand the attribute of area before measuring. Although there is no explicit mention of area
            in grades preK&#8211;2, children are expected to &#8220;Describe several measurable attributes of a single
            object&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" >CCSSO, 2010</a>, p. 12) and to
            partition geometric shapes into equal shares. In addition, data from the 2011 NAEP suggest that fourth-grade
            students have an incomplete understanding of area, with only 24
            percent able to find the area of a square given a perimeter of 12 units&#8212;even with a drawing of the
            square with tick marks around the sides. Instead, 44 percent merely counted the eight tick marks around the
            edge <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_153" >(National Center for Educational
                Statistics, 2014)</a>. Estimating and measuring area begins in third grade, as students connect to
            multiplication, and continue in grade 4 with finding the area of rectangles using formulas and real-world
            problems. Clearly, children in the earlier grades can and should explore the concept of area informally to
            lay a better foundation for later study.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Comparison Activities</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Comparing area measures is more of a conceptual challenge than comparing length measures because areas come
            in a variety of shapes. Consequently, comparison activities with areas should help children distinguish
            between size (i.e., area) and shape, length, and other dimensions. A long, skinny rectangle may have less
            area than a triangle with shorter sides. Also important to understand is the idea that rearranging areas
            into different shapes does not affect the amount of area (although the perimeter can change). These ideas
            are especially difficult for young children to understand.</p>
        <p>Direct comparison of two areas is frequently impossible except when the shapes involved have some common
            dimension or property. For example, two rectangles with the same width can be compared directly, as can any
            two circles. Comparison of these special shapes, however, does not challenge children to think deeply about
            the attribute of area. Instead, activities in which one area is rearranged (conservation of area) are
            suggested, like the next activity.</p>

                inch index cards. Each pair of children will need six rectangles. Have children fold and cut the
                rectangles on the diagonal, making two identical triangles. Next, have them rearrange the triangles into
                different shapes, including back into the original rectangle. (Having the original rectangle to compare
                to the other shapes helps children verify that the area remains the same.) The rule is that only sides
                of the same length can be matched up and must be matched exactly. Have children work in pairs to find
                all the shapes that can be made this way, gluing the triangles on paper as a record <span id="page356"

            <h4 class="title">Using Physical Models of Area Units</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Children need multiple opportunities to &#8220;cover the surface&#8221; of two-dimensional shapes to help
            develop their understanding of the attribute of area. Although squares are the most common area units, any
            tile that conveniently fills up a plane region can be used initially to explore the concept of area. Here
            are some suggestions for nonstandard area units:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p><em>Round counters, chips, or pennies.</em> It is not necessary that the area units fit with no gaps
                    for early explorations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Playing cards or small cardboard squares.</em> For relatively smaller areas, these area units
                    work well and fit together with no gaps.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Sheets of newspaper or large cardboard squares.</em> These make excellent units for very large
                    areas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Pattern blocks.</em> The hexagon, trapezoid, blue rhombus, and triangle are easily compared to
                    each other by laying one on top of the other.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, standard units can be used:</p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
            <li>
                <p>Color tiles (1-inch sides).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>White Cuisenaire rods or the unit cube from base-ten blocks (1-cm sides).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span id="page358" class="pagebreak" title="358" />Children can use units to measure surfaces in the room
            such as desktops, bulletin boards, and books. Large regions can be outlined with masking tape on the f loor.
            Small regions can be duplicated on paper so that children can work at stations.</p>
        <p>In area measurements, there may be units that only partially fit. You may wish to begin with shapes in which
            complete units fit by building a shape with units and then drawing the outline. Once your children have
            experience covering regions with units and after they have learned to partition geometric shapes into equal
            shares, consider giving them a shape for which they have to consider partial units, as seen in <a
                class="xref" href="#fig_15_11">Figure 15.11</a>.</p>

                that are formed where the cards meet the diagonal, can count each 2 as one square. There is about
                one-half of a square in the upper corner of the diagonal and in the opposite corner that together can

                fill in the shapes (e.g., color tiles, round counters). Alternatively, they can trace or glue the same
                two-dimensional unit on the shapes. Children should explain their strategy and justification in writing.

        <p>Your objective in the beginning is to develop the idea that area is measured by covering or tiling. Groups
            will likely find different measures for the same region. Discuss these differences with the children and
            point to the difficulties involved in making estimates around the edges. Avoid the idea that there is one
            &#8220;right&#8221; approach.</p>
