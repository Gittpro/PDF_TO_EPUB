<h3 class="title">Volume and Capacity</h3>
</header>
<p><em>Volume</em> and <em>capacity</em> are both terms for measures of the &#8220;size&#8221; of three-dimensional regions. The term <em>capacity</em> is generally used to refer to the amount that a container will hold. Standard units of capacity include quarts, gallons, liters, and milliliters&#8212;units used for liquids as well as the containers that hold them. The term <em>volume</em> can be used to refer to the capacity of a container but is also used for the amount of space occupied by three-dimensional objects. Standard units of volume are expressed in terms of cubic length units, such as cubic inches or cubic centimeters. Although standard units for capacity and volume are beyond the expectations for the preK&#8211;2
grades, we list them here to further distinguish between volume and capacity.</p>

<h4 class="title">Comparison Activities</h4></header>
<p>The apparent volumes of solid objects are sometimes misleading, and a method of comparison is also very difficult, especially for primary grade children. So for the preK&#8211;2 grades, it is appropriate to focus on capacity. A simple method for comparing <span id="page359" class="pagebreak" title="359" />capacity is to fill one container with something and then pour the same amount into the comparison container.</p>
<p>Young children should have lots of experiences directly comparing the capacities of different containers as in the following activity.</p>

<p>Provide a variety of containers, with one marked as the &#8220;target.&#8221; Ask children to sort the collection into those that hold more than, less than, or about the same amount as the target container. They are then to use the <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Capacity_Sort.pdf" class="ulink">Capacity Sort</a> recording sheet to circle the estimate of &#8220;holds more,&#8221; &#8220;holds less,&#8221; or &#8220;holds about the same.&#8221; Provide a filler (such as beans, rice, or Styrofoam peanuts), scoops, and funnels. Working in pairs, have children measure and record results under &#8220;Actual Measure&#8221; on their recording sheet. Discuss what children noticed (e.g., that rounder/fatter shapes hold more).</p>

<h4 class="title">Using Physical Models of Volume and Capacity Units</h4></header>
<p>Two types of units can be used to measure volume and capacity: solid units and containers. Solid units are things like wooden cubes or tennis balls that can be used to fill the container being measured. The other unit model is a small container that is filled with liquid and poured repeatedly into the container being measured. The following examples are of units that you might want to collect.</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><p>Plastic liquid medicine cups</p></li>
<li><p>Plastic jars and containers of almost any size</p></li>
<li><p>Wooden cubes or same-sized blocks of any shape</p></li>
<li><p>Styrofoam packing peanuts (produces conceptual measures of volume despite not packing perfectly)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember your goal is to help children develop an understanding of the concept of capacity or volume. Children often think that a tall, narrow container holds more than a short, wide one because it is difficult for them to attend to two dimensions, the height and width. By having them explore capacity using a variety of containers, you can challenge this misconception. Try the following activity yourself as well as with children.</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-labelledby="Activity-15-25">
<header><h4 class="title" id="Activity-15-25">Activity 15.25 Which Silo Holds More?</h4></header>

<p>Give pairs of children two sheets of equal-sized paper. With one sheet they make a tube shape (cylinder) by taping the two long edges together. They make a shorter, fatter cylinder from the other sheet by taping the short edges together. Then ask, &#8220;If these were two silos, would they hold the same amount, or would one hold more than the other?&#8221; To test the conjectures, use a filler such as rice or pasta. Place the skinny cylinder inside the fat one. Fill the inside tube and then lift it up, allowing the filler to empty into the fat cylinder.</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page360" class="pagebreak" title="360" />You can also have children begin to use cups, pints, quarts, and gallon containers to help them begin to get a sense of their sizes. Having them use, for example, a measuring cup to fill a pint container or a pint container to fill a gallon container can help them begin to develop a sense of the relative sizes of customary units of capacity.</p>
