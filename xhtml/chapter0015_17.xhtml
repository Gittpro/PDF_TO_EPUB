            <h2 class="title">Common Misconceptions with Measurement</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This chapter began by highlighting that measurement is one of the most useful mathematics content strands
            because it is such a vital component in so many work- and life-related activities. Yet, measurement
            continues to be an area in which elementary school children in the United States consistently perform lower
            than the international average (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_487" >Provasnik,
                2012</a>).</p>
        <p><span id="page361" class="pagebreak" title="361" /><a class="xref" href="#Tab_15_2">Table 15.2</a> provides a
            summary of the most common errors and misconceptions children will demonstrate with measurement, along with
            suggestions about how to help them work through these issues. Purposefully look for and target these common
            misconceptions that can interfere with your children&#8217;s understanding of measurement concepts and
            skills.</p>
