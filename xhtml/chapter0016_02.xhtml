            <h2 class="title">Developing Geometric Reasoning</h2>
        </header>
        <p>All learners are capable of growing and developing the ability to think and reason in geometric contexts, but
            this ability requires ongoing and significant experiences across a developmental progression. Recently in
            mathematics education there has been an emphasis on using learning progressions and trajectories to help
            children move forward logically when learning different mathematics concepts and skills. Fortunately, in
            geometry such a progression has been well documented. The research of two Dutch educators, Pierre van Hiele
            and Dina van Hiele-Geldof, provides insight into the differences in geometric thinking through the
            descriptions of different levels of thought. The <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_510"
                >van Hiele theory (1984)</a> significantly inf luences geometry curricula
            worldwide and can help all teachers understand developmentally appropriate next steps for their
            children&#8217;s geometry instruction.</p>
        <header id="chap16-head3_1">
            <h3 class="title">The van Hiele Levels of Geometric Thought</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The van Hiele model is typically described as a five-level hierarchy of understanding spatial ideas (see <a
                class="xref" href="#fig_16_1">Figure 16.1</a>). Each level describes the thinking processes used in
            geometric contexts. Specifically, the levels describe what types of geometric ideas we think about (called
            <em>objects of though</em>t), how we think about those ideas, and what students can do (called <em>products
                of thought</em>). <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_495" >Clements and Battista
                (1992)</a> proposed the existence of a level prior to the first level in the van Hiele model. We include
            this level because of its power to help you make sense of some of your young children&#8217;s geometric
            reasoning (lower left in <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_1">Figure 16.1</a>); however, we have left this
            initial level unnumbered and maintained the original numbering of the van Hiele levels to be consistent with
            other resources and the other volumes in this series. In this volume, we will focus on Pre-recognition and
            Levels 0 and 1, as Levels 2, 3 and 4 are beyond the scope of this book.</p>

        <p><em>The objects of thought at this level are specific visible or tactile objects.</em></p>
        <p>Children at this level are unable to identify and distinguish between many common shapes. They may notice
            only a subset of the visual characteristics of a shape, which results in an inability to distinguish between
            some shapes. For example, they may be able to distinguish between a circle and a square but not between a
            square and a triangle. Most prerecognition level children will know something about circles and squares but
            they tend to be less accurate identifying triangles and rectangles. Prerecognition children may identify any
            shape that has a prominent &#8220;point&#8221; as a triangle and any four-sided shape with long parallel
            sides as a rectangle (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_496" >Clements &amp; Sarama,

        <p><em>The objects of thought at level 0 are shapes and what they &#8220;look like.&#8221;</em></p>
        <p>Children at level 0 recognize and name figures based on global visual characteristics of the
            figure&#8212;using &#8220;vague holistic judgments&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_492"
                >Battista, p. 1, 2012</a>) to justify their identifications. For example, a
            circle is defined by a level 0 child as a circle
            &#8220;because it looks like a loop&#8221; or a shape is a rectangle &#8220;because it looks like a
            door.&#8221; Because appearance is dominant at this level, appearances can overpower a child&#8217;s
            thinking about the properties of a shape. A level 0 thinker, for example, may see a square with sides that
            are not horizontal or vertical (it appears tilted) and believe it is a &#8220;diamond&#8221; (not a
            mathematical term) and no longer a square. Children at this level will sort and classify shapes based on
            their appearances&#8212;&#8220;I put these together because they are all pointy&#8221; (or
            &#8220;fat,&#8221; &#8220;look like a house,&#8221; &#8220;are dented in,&#8221; and so on). Children are
            able to see how shapes are alike and different and as a result, they can create and begin to understand
            classifications of shapes.</p>

        <p>The emphasis at level 0 is on shapes that children can observe, feel, build (compose), take apart
            (decompose), or work with in some manner. The general goal is to explore how shapes are alike and different
            and use these ideas to create classes of shapes (both physically and mentally). Some of these classes of
            shapes have names&#8212;rectangles, triangles, prisms, cylinders, and so on. Properties of shapes, such as
            parallel sides, symmetry, right angles, and so on, are included at this level but only in an informal,
            observational manner.</p>
        <p>The following activity is a good representation of an experience for level 0 learners as it focuses on how
            shapes are alike and different.</p>

                    href="#fig_16_3">Figure 16.3</a>) on the following related activities, to be done in the order
                shown.</p>
            <ul class="bulleted">
                <li>Each child selects a shape. In turn, the children tell one or two things they find interesting about
                    their shape.</li>
                <li>Children each randomly select two shapes and try to find something that is alike about their two
                    shapes and something that is different.</li>
                <li>The group selects one target shape at random and places it in the center of the workspace. Their
                    task is to find all other shapes that are like the target shape according to the same rule. For
                    example, if they say, &#8220;This shape is like the target shape because it has a curved side and a
                    straight side,&#8221; then all other shapes that they put in the collection must have these
                    properties. <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_4">Figure 16.4</a> illustrates a few of the many possible
                    ways a set might be sorted. Challenge children to do a second sort with the same target shape but
                    using a different property.</li>
                <li>Do a &#8220;secret sort.&#8221; You (or one of the children) create a small collection of about five
                    shapes that fit a secret rule. Leave other shapes that belong in your set in the pile. Children try
                    to find additional pieces that belong to the set and/or guess the secret rule.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most of these activities can and should be done with three-dimensional shapes as well. See the <a
                        href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/Expanded_Lesson_Shape_Sorts.pdf"
                        class="ulink">Expanded Lesson: Shape Sorts</a> for an enhanced version of this
                activity.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>These find-a-rule activities can elicit a wide variety of ideas as children examine the shapes. They may
            start describing the shapes with ideas such as &#8220;curvy&#8221; or &#8220;looks like a tree&#8221; rather
            than typical geometric properties. But as children notice more sophisticated properties you can attach
            appropriate names to them. For example, some children may notice that some shapes have corners &#8220;like a
            square&#8221; (explain that those are also called <em>right angles</em>) or that &#8220;these shapes are the
            same on both sides&#8221; (explain that we call that <em>symmetry</em>).</p>
        <p>What makes this a level 0 activity is that children are operating on the shapes that they see in front of
            them and are beginning to see similarities and differences in shapes. By forming groups of shapes, they
            begin to imagine other shapes that are not present in the collection that belong to the groups they have
            identified.</p>

                shapes rather than individual shapes.</em></p>
        <p>Children at the analysis level are able to think about and identify shapes &#8220;by describing their parts
            and the spatial relationships between the parts&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_492"
                >Battista</a>, p. 2, <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_492"
                >2012</a>). They are able to consider all shapes within a class rather than
            just the single shape on their desk. Instead of talking about <em>this</em> rectangle, they can talk about
            <em>all</em> rectangles. By focusing on a class of shapes, children are able to think about what makes a
            rectangle a rectangle (four sides, opposite sides parallel, opposite sides of the same length, four right
            angles, congruent diagonals, etc.). The irrelevant features (such as size or orientation) fade into the
            background, and children begin to understand that if a shape belongs to a particular class such as cubes, it
            has the corresponding properties of that class: &#8220;All cubes have six congruent faces, and each of those
            faces is a square.&#8221; These properties were unspoken at level 0. Children operating at level 1
            may be able to list all the properties of squares, rectangles, and parallelograms but may not see that these
            are subclasses of one another&#8212;that all squares are rectangles and all rectangles are parallelograms.
            In defining a shape, level 1 thinkers are likely to list as many properties of the shapes as they know.</p>
        <p><em>The products of thought at level 1 are the properties of shapes.</em></p>
        <p>Although level 1 children will continue to use physical models and drawings of shapes, they begin to see
            these individual shapes as representatives of classes of shapes. Their understanding of the properties of
            shapes, such as symmetry, perpendicular and parallel lines, and so on, continues to be refined. The
            identification of properties is an important cognitive activity (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_512"
                >Yu, Barrett, &amp; Presmeg, 2009</a>).</p>
        <p>In the following activity, level 1 children use the properties of shapes such as symmetry, angle
            classification (right, obtuse, acute), parallel and perpendicular, and the concept of congruent line
            segments and angles.</p>

                aloud, and having children point to the attribute on a shape as you say the word are ways to reinforce
                meaning and support their participation in discussions.</p>
            <p>This activity may take two or three days. Share lists beginning with parallelograms, then rhombi, then
                rectangles, and finally squares. Have one group present its list. Then others who worked on the same
                shape should add to or subtract from it. The class must agree with everything that is put on the list.
                As new relationships come up in this presentation-and-discussion period, you can introduce proper
                terminology. For example, if an angle is larger than a right angle, then it is called <em>obtuse</em>.
                Other terms such as <em>acute, parallel,</em> and so on can be clarified as you help children write
                their descriptions.</p>

        <p>Compare the last activity, &#8220;Property Lists for Quadrilaterals,&#8221; with Activity 16.2, &#8220;Shape
            Sorts.&#8221; In &#8220;Shape Sorts,&#8221; the objects of children&#8217;s thought are the very shapes that
            are in front of them. The results of that activity are collections or classifications of shapes. For young
            children, these classifications will be nonstandard groupings that make sense to the children&#8212;fat,
            tall, pointy, looks like a house, and so on. Soon they will also construct standard groupings that have
            standard names&#8212;squares, triangles, rectangles, prisms, and so on&#8212;as you supply the appropriate
            names as the collections are developed.</p>
        <p>In &#8220;Property Lists for Quadrilaterals,&#8221; the children only see a small collection of shapes at the
            top of their paper. However, the object of their thinking is the entire class of shapes for which these few
            are representative. In other words, children must assess whether the properties apply to all shapes in the
            category. In &#8220;Property Lists for Quadrilaterals&#8221; the object of thinking is the very type of
            thing (a class of shapes) that was the product of thinking in &#8220;Shape Sorts&#8221; at level 0.</p>

                Once you know, how will you select the right activities to match your children&#8217;s levels? As you
                conduct an activity, listen to the types of observations that children make and record them on an
                <a
                        href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM33_Observation_Checklist.pdf"

                understand that shapes do not change when the orientation or size changes? Do they use properties in
                their descriptions and discussions of shapes? Can your children talk about shapes as classes? Do they
                refer, for example, to &#8220;rectangles&#8221; or do they base their discussion on a particular
                rectangle? Do they generalize that certain properties are attributable to a type of shape or simply the
                shape at hand? With careful observations such as these, you will soon be able to distinguish between the
                various levels.</p>
