        <p>This is the content area most often associated with geometry in preK through grade 8 classrooms. The early
            grades are the time when young children begin to &#8220;perceive, say, describe/discuss and construct
            objects in 2-D space&#8221; (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_506" >National
                Research Council Committee, 2009</a>, p. 177) but children need experience with a wide variety of both
            two- and three-dimensional shapes (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_498" >Clements
                &amp; Sarama, 2014</a>). Triangles should be shown in more than just equilateral forms and not always
            with the vertex at the top. (If children say a triangle is upside down, it may be because they have rarely
            seen triangles illustrated differently.) Shapes should have curved sides, straight sides, and combinations
            of these. As children describe the shape or property, the terminology can be introduced.</p>
        <p>The next activity can be modified to accommodate children at the prerecognition level, level 0, and level 1
            by altering the object of the search. Here we focus on children at the prerecognition level.</p>

            <p>Use masking tape to create a large target shape that children can walk around on the community rug or
                floor. Ask children if they can name the shape or any attributes (such as straight or curved sides,
                number of sides, right angles, and so on). Make sure children, especially ELLs, understand the terms you
                use such as <em>square corners</em> and <em>right turns</em>. You can compare a square corner (right
                angle) to a capital &#8220;L&#8221; or the corner of a sheet of paper or an index card. You can also
                have the children draw the shape in the air or on paper. Then ask the children to find one or two items
                in the classroom, on the playground, or somewhere else at school that have this same shape or attribute.
                Take photos of the examples that children find so that they can be used later in the discussion. As
                children find their examples, ask them how they know it is like the target shape. Listen for how they
                describe their example. What are they focusing on? What words are they using? For children with
                disabilities, provide a cutout of the target shape that they can take with them as they search for an
                example.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>In &#8220;Shape Show and Hunt,&#8221; have children search for various shapes as well as properties of
            shapes. A shape hunt will be much more successful if you let children look for either one thing or for a
            specific list. Some examples that children can search for are: right angles (&#8220;square corners&#8221;);
            curved surfaces or curved lines; two or more shapes that can be put together to make another shape; circles
            inside each other (concentric); shapes with &#8220;dents&#8221; (concave) or without &#8220;dents&#8221;
            (convex); and solids that are like a box (prism), a cylinder, a pyramid, or a cone. <em>Cubes, Cones,
                Cylinders, and Spheres</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_502" >Hoban,
                2000</a>) shows photographs of three-dimensional shapes from everyday life that you can share with
            children.</p>

            cutout overlays of circles, rectangles, triangles, and other familiar shapes, images of either farm or zoo
            animals are created. The reader turns the page to remove a shape, transforming the image into a new animal.

            <p>After identifying and talking about the relevant attributes of a three-dimensional shape, have the
                children pretend they are inside of it. For example, after showing the children an oatmeal box
                (cylinder), tell them to pretend they are inside of the oatmeal box. Tell them to close their eyes and
                pretend to touch the walls of the cylinder. Ask them to describe the walls. Then have them pretend to
                trace the top of the cylinder and then the bottom of the cylinder with their finger. Ask, &#8220;What is
                the shape you traced?&#8221; (You can also have children draw the shape on paper.) The activity can be
                repeated with other 3-D shapes, such as a prism, where they feel and try to identify each face. Try to
                find large boxes or tubes for your children to get in so they can actually feel the inside and outside
                of the shapes.</p>

            <p>Draw an example of a two-dimensional shape on the board or projection unit. Ask children to name the
                shape and tell how they know. Draw another shape that is somehow different from the first shape&#8212;it
                could be another example of the shape or a nonexample that looks like the target shape and that children
                could mistake for the shape. For example, if the target shape is a triangle, display triangles that are
                &#8220;skinny&#8221; or oriented with the vertex pointing down. Or display a three-sided shape whose
                sides are not straight. You can also provide counterexamples such as a &#8220;triangle&#8221; musical
                instrument that has an open side. Have children identify and discuss the differences and whether those
                differences make the figure a nonexample. Summarize by highlighting the relevant features of the target

                nine sticks of different lengths that can be used to make two- and three-dimensional shapes.) Children
                make the shapes by placing the stirrers on the drawings with the stirrers &#8220;connected&#8221; or
                touching at their endpoints. Have children name the shape and talk about the attributes. Challenge

            <h3 class="title">Sorting and Classifying</h3>
        </header>
        <p>As young children work at classification of shapes, be prepared for them to notice features that you do not
            consider to be &#8220;real&#8221; geometric attributes, such as &#8220;dented&#8221; or &#8220;looks like a
            rocket.&#8221; Children at this level will also attribute to shapes ideas that are not part of the shape,
            such as &#8220;points up&#8221; or &#8220;has a side that is the same as the edge of the board.&#8221;</p>
        <p>For variety in two-dimensional shapes, use materials like a set of <a
                    href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Assorted_Shapes.pdf"
                    class="ulink">2-D Assorted Shapes</a>. Make multiple copies so that groups of children can
            all work with the same shapes. Once you have your sets constructed, try <a
                href="chapter0016_02.xhtml#Activity-16-2">Activity 16.2</a> &#8220;Shape Sorts.&#8221; The secret sort
            in is one option for introducing a new property. For example, sort the shapes so that all have at least one
            right angle or &#8220;square corner.&#8221; When children discover your rule, you have an opportunity to
            talk more about that property and name the property &#8220;right angle.&#8221;</p>

                &#8220;no&#8221; questions. The group can eliminate shapes (by turning over the cards) as they get
                answers about the properties that narrow down the possibilities. They are not allowed to point to a
                piece and ask, &#8220;Is it this one?&#8221; Rather, they must continue to ask questions about
                properties or characteristics that reduce the choices to one shape. The final shape card is checked
                against the one in the leader&#8217;s folder. Provide a list of properties and characteristics (such as
                number of sides) to support the question asking of children with disabilities.</p>

            <p>The ways children describe these three-dimensional shapes provides good evidence of their level of
                thinking. The classifications made by level 0 thinkers are generally restricted to the shapes they have
                in front of them. Level 1 thinkers will begin to create categories based on properties, and their
                language will indicate that they know there are many more shapes in the group than those that are
                present. Children may say things such as, &#8220;These shapes have square corners sort of like
                rectangles,&#8221; or &#8220;These look like boxes. All the boxes have square (rectangular)

            <p>You will need two sets of shapes, one that you will display and one that you will use to select a secret
                shape from. On one day, focus on two-dimensional shapes. On another day, use three-dimensional shapes.
                Give children time to explore the displayed shapes, asking them to run their fingers along the sides and
                around the corners (faces and edges for 3-D shapes). Secretly select one of the shapes from your set and
                place it in a box or a bag. Use a box with holes cut into the sides or a bag that has elastic around the
                top&#8212;or you could use a long sock. The idea is for children to be able to get their hands into the
                box, bag, or sock without being able to peek! Have the children try to guess what shape it is by feeling
                it. You can have one child feel the shape and describe its properties to others so that they can decide
                which of the displayed shapes it matches.</p>
