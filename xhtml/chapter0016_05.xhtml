        <p>Children need to freely explore how shapes fit together to form larger shapes (compose) and how larger shapes
            can be made of smaller shapes (decompose). Geometric measurement, such as finding area and volume, uses this
            ability to compose and decompose shapes.</p>

                class="ulink">Tangrams</a> are the best known two-dimensional shapes for these kind of activities. Use
            pattern blocks or shapes cut from card stock to create designs for children to copy (see <a class="xref"
                href="#fig_16_7">Figure 16.7</a>). To increase the level of difficulty, provide only the outside outline
            of the design. Children can then create their own designs using these materials. <a

                parts with 3 of the 4 parts divided further. Children can use pattern blocks to compose and decompose
                different shapes. Four shapes are constructed from pattern blocks. the first shape has a trapezoid and 3
                triangles, the second, 2 hexagons and 2 triangles, the third, 1 hexagon and 3 trapezoids, the fourth 3

                can compose shapes using different pattern blocks. It also provides five outlines of different designs
                where children have to decide which shapes are used to complete the designs. Also, the National Library
                of Virtual Manipulatives has a tangram applet with a set of fourteen puzzle figures that can be made
                using all seven of the pieces. The e-version of tangrams has the benefit of requiring the child to be
                much more deliberate in arranging the shapes because they have to anticipate how they will transform
                (e.g., flip, rotate) a given shape to make it fit.</p>

        <p>Teach children from the very beginning how to record their designs on geoboard recording sheets. To help
            children who struggle with this transfer, suggest that they first mark the dots for the corners of their
            shape (&#8220;second row, end peg&#8221;). With the corners identified, it is much easier for them to draw
            lines between the corners to make the shape. These drawings can be placed in groups for classification and
            discussion or sent home to families to showcase what children are learning.</p>

                shape with a straight line, forming two shapes, and then they are to identify each shape using
                properties, such as the number of sides (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_12">Figure 16.12</a>).
                Challenge children to determine whether they can create two shapes with the same number of sides, more
                sides, or fewer sides than the original shape. Children with disabilities may find it challenging to see
                that the new shapes share one side and may miscount the number of sides of each. Allow them to cut out
                the new shapes if this is an issue.</p>

            <p>5 shapes each contain a dotted segment that divides the shape into 2 parts. The first shape, begins with
                a triangle, 3 sides. A dotted diagonal extends from one side to another and forms new shapes: Triangle,
                3 sides, and a quadrilateral, 4 sides. The second shape, begins with a quadrilateral, 4 sides. A
                diagonal extends from a vertex to the opposite side to form new shapes: Triangle, 3 sides, and a
                quadrilateral, 4 sides. The third shape, begins with a hexagon, 6 sides. A dotted segment extends from a
                vertex to the opposite vertex to form new shapes: 2 Quadrilaterals, 4 sides, each. the fourth shape,
                begins with a pentagon, 5 sides. A dotted segment extends from a vertex to an opposite side to form new
                shapes: Triangle, 3 sides, and a pentagon, 5 sides. The fifth shape begins with a pentagon, 5 sides. A
                dotted segment extends from a side to an opposite side to form new shapes: Quadrilateral, 4 sides, and a
                pentagon, 5 sides.</p>
