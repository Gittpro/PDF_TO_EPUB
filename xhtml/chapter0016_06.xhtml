<h3 class="title">Categories of Two- and Three-Dimensional Shapes</h3>
</header>
<p>As children&#8217;s attention shifts to properties of shapes (moving to level 1 thinking), you will hear them use properties in their reasoning and discussions. Notice that the definitions of two- and three-dimensional shapes support the exploration of the relationships between shapes.</p>

<p>*Some def initions of trapezoid specify <em>only one</em> pair of parallel sides, in which case parallelograms would not be trapezoids. The University of Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP) uses the &#8220;at least one pair&#8221; def inition, meaning that parallelograms and rectangles are trapezoids. Some regions mandate one def inition over another, so consult your local curriculum (Manizade &amp; Mason, 2014).</p>

<p>The classification of simple closed curves includes sets of shapes that are, concave, convex, polygons and simple closed curves. The classification of triangles includes set of equilateral, isosceles, scalene, acute, right and obtuse triangles. The classification of convex quadrilaterals includes sets of shapes that have no sides parallel, including kites, trapezoids, including isosceles, parallelograms, rhombi, rectangles and squares. There are many ways to sort polygons. Many with three and four sides have special names. A graphic organizer is a set of ovals embedded in larger ovals to show relationships is labeled, where Level 1 thinking does not yet recognize these sub relationships. In the center is an oval, squares that sits on an oval extending right, rectangles and an oval extending left, rhombuses. These ovals are contained in an oval, parallelograms, which is then contained in a larger oval, trapezoids and then contained in the largest oval, convex quadrilaterals.</p></details>
<p><span id="page384" class="pagebreak" title="384" />In the classification of quadrilaterals and parallelograms, some subsets overlap. For example, a square is a rectangle and a rhombus. All parallelograms are trapezoids, but not all trapezoids are parallelograms. Children often have difficulty seeing this type of subcategory. They may correctly list all the properties of a square, a rhombus, and a rectangle and still might identify a square as a &#8220;nonrhombus&#8221; or a &#8220;nonrectangle.&#8221; To help children think about this relationship, suggest that a child can be on two different sports teams or belong to two different clubs. A square is an example of a quadrilateral that belongs to two other &#8220;clubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cylinders have two parallel faces, and parallel lines join corresponding points on these faces. If the parallel faces are polygons, the cylinder can be called a prism. 5 sets of cylinders and prisms. The first two sets are cylinders and not cylinders. The set of not cylinders contains a cone, a shape with 2 parallel faces and curved sides, a pyramid, and a shape with parallel lines that join faces that are not parallel. Three sets are special cylinders: prisms with faces that are polygons and some are slanted; right prisms with polygon faces and not tilted; and right cylinders, not prisms, which have faces that are not polygons.</p></details>
<p><span id="page385" class="pagebreak" title="385" />Some textbooks limit the definition of cylinders to just circular cylinders. These books do not have special names for other cylinders. Under that definition, the prism is not a special case of a cylinder. This points to the fact that definitions are conventions, and not all conventions are universally agreed upon.</p>

For your first collection be certain that you have allowed for all possible variables. For example, in <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_16">Figure 16.16</a>, a square is included in the set of rhombuses. Also, choose nonexamples to be as close to the examples as is necessary to help with a precise definition. The third or mixed set should also include those nonexamples with which children are most likely to be confused. Children should justify their choices in a class discussion. Note that the use of examples and nonexamples is particularly helpful for children with disabilities.</p>

Ask the teams to sort the entire collection of triangles into two or three groups so that no triangle belongs to two groups. Have them describe and discuss their groupings. If no group compared the length of sides or the size of the angles (i.e., congruent versus noncongruent) to form their groups, ask them to sort the entire collection by comparing the length of the sides (size of angles) within each triangle&#8212;delay giving these hints if you can. Again, no triangle should belong to two groups. When they complete this sort, have them describe and discuss their groupings. Provide appropriate terminology as ideas arise. For example, you can say, &#8220;A triangle that has all equal sides is a special triangle called an equilateral triangle.&#8221; Add this new terminology and corresponding illustrations to the math word wall. For ELLs and other children who may struggle with vocabulary, focus on the specialized meaning of these new terms (such as contrasting &#8220;acute pain&#8221; and &#8220;acute angle&#8221;&#8212;acute can mean sharp or pointed) and root words (such as <em>equi-</em> meaning <em>equal</em> and <em>&#8211;lateral</em> meaning <em>side</em>). Extend the activity by repeating the process using quadrilaterals or a particular type of three-dimensional shape (e.g., cylinders or pyramids).</p>

<h4 class="title">Construction Activities</h4></header>
<p>Building or drawing shapes is an important activity that requires children to pay attention to the properties and defining attributes of shapes <a href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" class="noteref_biblioref">(CCSSO, 2010)</a>. Young children should experience constructing two- and three-dimensional shapes using physical models.</p>
<p>For building two-dimensional models, use an activity like Activity 16.8, &#8220;Build It,&#8221; but do not provide drawings as models for children. Challenge them to create two or more examples of a target shape and have them explain why their examples are like that shape. See whether others in the class agree with their explanations.</p>
<p>Building three-dimensional shapes is more difficult than building two-dimensional shapes. A variety of commercial materials permit fairly creative construction of geometric solids (e.g., Polydron and the Zome System). Alternatively, you can collect the following sets of building materials listed in the next activity.</p>

<p>Have children use one of the following sets of materials for construction:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li><em>Plastic coffee stirrers with modeling clay or twisted ties.</em> Plastic stirrers can be cut into different lengths and used to build the edges of the three-dimensional shape. To connect corners, use small balls of clay or insert twisted ties into the ends of the stirrers.</li>
<li><span id="page388" class="pagebreak" title="388" /><em>Plastic drinking straws, pipe cleaners, and twist ties.</em> If you use drinking straws with flexible joints, cut the straws lengthwise from the top down to the flexible joint. These split ends can then be inserted into the uncut bottom ends of other straws, making a strong but flexible joint. Three or more straws are joined in this fashion to form two-dimensional polygons. Alternatively, you can use regular drinking straws, cut into various lengths, and insert two-inch lengths of pipe cleaner into the ends of the straws to form the corners/vertices. To make skeletal solids, use pipe cleaners or twist ties to join polygons side to side.</li>
<li><em>Rolled newspaper rods and tape.</em> Create superlarge skeletons using newspaper and masking tape or duct tape (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_17">Figure 16.17</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>With these homemade models, have children compare the strength and rigidity of triangular components with that of polygons with more than three sides. Point out that triangles are used in many bridges, in the long booms of construction cranes, in gates, and in the structural parts of buildings. Show children this <strong>video</strong> (<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8hG3xJitAg" class="ulink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8hG3xJitAg</a></strong>) of a math club project demonstrating how a bridge built from triangles is stronger than one built from squares.</p>

The list that follows is only a sample. Try combining two or more properties to create new challenges. Prompt children to create challenges that can be posted for others to make.</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>A shape with only one square corner and four sides</li>
<li>A shape with two square corners (or three, four, five, or six square corners)</li>
<li><span id="page389" class="pagebreak" title="389" />A shape with two pairs of parallel lines</li>
<li>A shape with two pairs of parallel lines and no right angles</li>
<li>A shape with one or two lines of symmetry (if your class has discussed symmetry) 	</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also include impossible tasks, such as a four-sided shape with exactly three right angles. Also, note that a triangle with three congruent sides (equilateral) is not possible on a geoboard.</p>
<p>By recording the solutions to these challenges, there is the added bonus of identifying classes of shapes possessing certain properties.</p>
