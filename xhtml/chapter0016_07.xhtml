<h2 class="title">Transformations</h2></header>
<p><em>Transformations</em> are changes in position or size of a shape. Usually, three transformations that describe changes in position are discussed at the PreK&#8211;2 level: <em>translations</em> (slides), <em>reflections</em> (flips), and <em>rotations</em> (turns). At the primary level, the terms <em>slide, flip,</em> and <em>turn</em> are adequate. Symmetry is included under the study of transformations due to its link to ref lections. Although transformations as not explicitly listed in the <em>Common Core</em> standards for K&#8211;2, transformations are implicit as children are expected to consider shapes in different orientations.</p>

<h3 class="title">Rigid Motions</h3>
</header>
<p>Movements that do not change the size or shape of the object are called &#8220;rigid motions.&#8221; Transformations at the Prek&#8211;2 level involve an introduction to the basic concepts of slides, flips, and turns that result in congruent shapes (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_18">Figure 16.18</a>). The goal is to help children recognize these transformations and to begin to explore their effects on simple shapes. Here are definitions of the rigid motions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Slide:</strong> A slide (translation) moves an object along a <em>distance</em> and in a <em>direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>Flip:</strong> A f lip (ref lection) requires a <em>line of reflection</em>. The ref lection is a transformation in which an object is f lipped over the line of ref lection.</p>
<p><strong>Turn:</strong> A turn (rotation) requires a <em>center of rotation</em> (a point) and <em>a degree of rotation</em> (up to 360 degrees).</p>

<img src="../images/Fig16-18.png" alt="Three movements of a shape. A slide has a shape that moves in an upward right direction. A turn is a shape that is rotated right in a circular path. Flip has a shape that is flipped over a line of reflection." /></figure>

<p><a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_498" >Clements and Sarama (2014)</a> recommend having children use computer programs and applets to explore slides, flips, and turns of objects because children have to anticipate which rigid motion is needed for a target outcome and then purposefully select the screen tools to perform the rigid motion, which makes the motions more explicit to children. You can also draw children&#8217;s attention to their intuitive use of rigid motions when they work on puzzles as they turn, f lip, and slide pieces into place. Have them describe how they are moving the puzzle pieces to make them fit. Use these experiences to help young children ref lect on how a shape does not change even as they change its position or orientation.</p>
<p>Flags can provide an interesting context for children to think about slides, turns, and flips because of how flags move in the wind. Read to children a book about different flags or share pictures of flags used by different countries (e.g., <em>Flags of the World</em> by Selvie Bednar, 2009). Then use the following activity to explore these motions.</p>

<p><span id="page390" class="pagebreak" title="390" />The NCTM&#8217;s Illuminations applet called &#8220;Shape Tool&#8221; allow children to flip, slide, and rotate shapes to create various patterns and fill in designs, which informally introduce them to transformations.</p>

Activity Page on the back, as in <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_19">Figure 16.19</a>). You want the back image to match the front image when held to the light. Cut off the excess paper to leave a square. Alternatively, you can make the same design on squares of card stock using a marker. Give all children a two-sided Motion Flag. It might be helpful, especially for children with disabilities, to give children two Motion Flags each, one to leave in the original position and the other to manipulate.</p>
<p>Demonstrate each of the rigid motions. A slide is simply that&#8212;Motion Flag moves over a particular distance (such as 4 inches right and 2 inches down). Demonstrate turns, using only a clockwise motion. Similarly, demonstrate a horizontal flip (top goes to bottom) and a vertical flip (left goes to right). For all children, especially ELLs, ensure that these demonstrations include explicit practice with the vocabulary and that visuals are posted for reference. Practice by having children start with their Motion Flag in the same orientation. As you announce one of the moves, children slide, flip, or turn their Motion Flag accordingly.</p>
<p>Then display two Motion Flags side by side in any orientation. The task is to decide what motion or combination of motions will get the flag on the left to match the flag on the right. Children use their own flag to work out a solution. Test the solutions that children offer. If both flags are in the same position, call that a slide.</p>
<p>Once children understand how to use the Motion Flag, they can work in pairs. They begin with their Motion Flags in the same position. One child then changes his or her Motion Flag and challenges the other child to say what motion is required to make the two Motion Flags match. The solution is then tested and the roles reversed.</p>

<p>Begin with the Motion Flag in the left position shown in <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_19">Figure 16.19</a>. What rigid motions are required to get the Motion Flag in the position on the right in <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_19">Figure 16.19</a>? Will it take one move or more than one move (transformation)? Try to find all the positions that require two moves. Are there any positions that require more than two moves?</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page391" class="pagebreak" title="391" />At first, children might be confused when they can&#8217;t get their Motion Flag into the new position with one transformation. This creates an excellent problem&#8212;but don&#8217;t be too quick to suggest that it may take two moves. There are often numerous ways to get the f lag to the new position.</p>
