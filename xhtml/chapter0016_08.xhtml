<h3 class="title">Line Symmetry</h3>
</header>
<p>Transformations for Prek&#8211;2 children should involve the initial development of line symmetry. If a shape can be folded on a line so that the two halves match exactly, then it is said to have <em>line symmetry</em> (sometimes called <em>reflectional</em> or <em>mirror symmetry</em>). Notice that the fold line is actually a line of <em>reflection</em>&#8212;the portion of the shape on one side of the line is ref lected onto the other side, demonstrating the connection between line symmetry and transformations (flips).</p>
<p>One way to introduce line symmetry is to show examples and nonexamples using an all-of-these/none-of-these approach, as in <a class="xref" href="chapter0016_06.xhtml#fig_16_16">Figure 16.16</a>. Here&#8217;s another possibility:</p>
<aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="sidenote_ch16-1">
<p>Fold a sheet of paper in half and cut out a shape of your choosing along the fold. Open the paper and describe what you notice.</p>
</aside>
<p>Another approach to introduce line symmetry is to use mirrors. When you place a mirror on a picture or design so that the mirror is perpendicular to the table, you see a shape with symmetry when you look in the mirror. Have children create designs with mirror images, as in the following activity.</p>

<p>Give children a plain sheet of paper with a straight line through the middle. Ask them to use no more than six to eight pattern blocks to make a design completely on one side of the line that touches the line in some way. When the one side is finished, children try to make the mirror image of their design on the other side of the line. After the design is complete, have children place the mirror on the line and look into it from the side of the original design to check their work. With the mirror in place they should see exactly the same image as they see when they raise the mirror. For children with disabilities, make sure the line of reflection is vertical with the design to the left and to the right of the line. The task is harder when the line is oriented horizontally or diagonally. You can also challenge children to make designs with more than one line of symmetry.</p>
</aside>
<p>Children often refer to the ideas of symmetry when working with pattern blocks and other designs. They may observe, &#8220;I can fold my butterf ly drawing and it matches!&#8221; or &#8220;This side of my pattern block design matches the other side.&#8221; Capitalize on these opportunities to discuss the idea of symmetry so your children have a strong foundation for more formal study that will come in later grades.</p>
