<p>In preK and kindergarten, children learn about everyday positional descriptions&#8212;<em>above, below, beside, in front of, behind,</em> and <em>next to</em> <a href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" class="noteref_biblioref">(CCSSO, 2010)</a>. These &#8220;place learnings&#8221; (<a href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_498" class="noteref_biblioref">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2014</a>) are useful for helping children begin to specify locations. However, helping children refine the way they reason and communicate about direction, distance, <span id="page392" class="pagebreak" title="392" /><span id="z30-6">and location enhances spatial understandings. Geometry, measurement, and algebra are all supported by the use of a grid system with numbers or coordinates attached that can specify the location. Children at the primary level can begin to think in terms of a grid system to identify location in preparation for more sophisticated ways of reasoning about location. </span></p>
<p>As children learn to use language to describe an object&#8217;s relative position in space they also need opportunities in which they have to pay attention to the space around them and how it is organized. Using and building simple maps can help children become more aware of their environment and how they navigate through it (e.g., <a href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_498" class="noteref_biblioref">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2014</a>). Children develop the ability to navigate by first paying attention to landmarks in their environment (<a href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_494" class="noteref_biblioref">Clements, 1999</a>). In the next activity children use a simple map that includes landmarks to locate hidden objects.</p>

<p>Prepare some simple maps of your playground area that identify some big landmarks and different paths through the playground area. Give different groups of children different maps. Children will use their map to move from one location to another to find a hidden treasure. On each map, highlight the starting point and the ending point and draw a path along the route you want children to take.</p>
</aside>
<p>After children have some experience using simple maps, having them create their own maps will help them not only notice landmarks but also how those landmarks are positioned in the environment as they are challenged to identify a path that connects these landmarks.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: K.G.A.1</strong></p>
<p>Identify landmarks in your classroom that children can use in their design of a classroom map showing a path from one landmark to another. For example, children can create a map between the block area and the sink. Mark the path first with masking tape and have children walk along the path, drawing their attention to objects they pass along the way. (These objects are other landmarks that they could include on their maps.) After they create their map, they can walk along the path again and add additional landmarks to their maps to improve the detail and usefulness of their maps.</p>
<p>The maps young children create can vary greatly due to individual children&#8217;s drawing skills. You do not want children to get bogged down in providing a lot of detail in representing landmarks, so explicitly demonstrate what you mean by simple drawings of landmarks. Alternatively, you can provide cutout pictures of the landmarks that they can glue to their maps so they can attend more to the positions of the landmarks in relation to each other and the path.</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page393" class="pagebreak" title="393" />When children are able to attend to and describe landmarks in the space around them, it is time to help them see the value of having a way to specify location without pointing or identifying specific landmarks. The next activity can serve as a readiness task for coordinates as children refine their ways of describing location.</p>

<p>Give each child a <strong><a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Hidden_Positions_Gameboard.pdf" class="ulink">Hidden Positions Gameboard</a></strong>. Two children sit with a &#8220;screen&#8221; separating their desktop space so that neither child can see the other&#8217;s grid (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_20">Figure 16.20</a>). Each child has four different pattern blocks. The first player places a block on four different sections of the grid. He then tells the other player where to put blocks on her grid to match his own. When all four pieces are positioned, the two grids are checked to see if they are alike. Then the players switch roles. Model the game once by taking the part of the first child. Use words such as <em>top row, middle row, last row, above, below, next to,</em> and <em>beside.</em> Children can play in pairs as a station activity. For children with disabilities, consider starting with just one shape, then move to two shapes, and so on. For children ready for a greater challenge, increase the size of the grid up to 6 * 6. As the grid size increases, notice how the need for a system of labeling positions increases.</p>
</aside>
<p>As children begin to see the need to label positions (possibly because they have played &#8220;Hidden Positions&#8221; with an extended grid), they can begin to use simple coordinates to describe positions. Use a <strong><a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/V1_Simple_Coordinate_Grid_NEW.pdf" class="ulink">Simple Coordinate Grid</a></strong> like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_21">Figure 16.21</a> and explain how to use two numbers to designate an intersection point on the grid. The first number tells how far to move to the right. The second number tells how far to move up. Initially use the words along with the numbers: &#8220;right 3 and up 0.&#8221; Be sure to include 0 in your introduction. Then select a point on the grid and have children decide what two numbers name that point. If your point is at (2,4) and children incorrectly say &#8220;four, two,&#8221; then simply indicate where the point is that they named.</p>
<p>The next activity explores the notion of different paths on a grid.</p>

Using a projection unit or floor tiles, demonstrate how to describe a path from A to B. For the points in the figure, one path is &#8220;up 5 and right 6.&#8221; Another path might be &#8220;right 2, up 3, right 4, up 2.&#8221; Count the length of each path. As long as you always move toward the target point (in this case either right or up), the path lengths will always be the same. Here they are 11 units long. Children draw three paths on their papers from A to B using different-colored crayons. For each path they write directions that describe their paths. Ask the children, &#8220;What is the greatest number of turns that you can make in your path? What is the smallest number? Where would A and B have to be in order to get there with no turns?&#8221; For children who need a challenge, add a coordinate system on the grid and have them describe their paths using coordinates. For example, (1,2) S (3,2) S (3,5) S (7,5) S (7,7).</p>

<p>The &#8220;Hiding Lady Bug&#8221; applet on NCTM&#8217;s Illuminations website is similar to &#8220;Paths&#8221; but offers some additional challenges. Children move a ladybug by listing directions that will hide a ladybug beneath a leaf. When the directions are complete, the ladybug is set in motion to follow them. The ladybug can also be directed to draw shapes such as a rectangle or to travel through mazes. Creating directions and predicting their outcome will help children develop ideas about navigation and location as they hone their visualization skills.</p>
</aside>

        <p>Once a coordinate system has been introduced, children may want to use it in a simple game similar to the
            commercial game called &#8220;Battleship.&#8221; Each player has a grid similar to the one in <a
                class="xref" href="#fig_16_21">Figure 16.21</a>. Players secretly put their initials on five
            intersections of their own grid. You can use a context to make the game more motivating. For example, these
            locations could indicate the location of hidden treasures. Then, with the grids kept separate as in
            &#8220;Hidden Positions,&#8221; the players take turns trying to locate the other player&#8217;s hidden
            treasures by naming a point on the grid using coordinates. The other player indicates if the guess was a hit
            or a miss. When a player scores a hit, he or she gets another turn. Each player keeps track of where he or
            she has guessed locations, recording an &#8220;X&#8221; for a hit and a &#8220;0&#8221; for a miss. The game
            ends when one player has found all of the other player&#8217;s hidden treasures.</p>
