<h2 class="title">Visualization</h2></header>
<p>Visualization might be called &#8220;geometry done with the mind&#8217;s eye.&#8221; It involves being able to create mental images of shapes and then turn them around mentally, thinking about how they look from different viewpoints and predicting the results of various transformations. It involves imagining the impact of certain actions on two- and three-dimensional shapes, such as what the parts would look like if you cut a shape in half or rotated it a quarter turn. Any activity that requires children to think about, manipulate, or transform a shape mentally or to represent a shape as it is seen visually will contribute to the development of children&#8217;s visualization skills.</p>

<h3 class="title">Two-Dimensional Imagery</h3>
</header>
<p>Children at the prerecognition level may notice only a subset of the visual characteristics of a shape, which results in an inability to distinguish between some shapes. Therefore, visualization activities for this level will have children trying to attend to the details of images. The following activity is based on an idea from NCTM&#8217;s <em>Principles and Standards for Mathematics</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_504" >National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000</a>).</p>

Then have children attempt to reproduce it on their own. Show the same figure again for a few seconds and allow children to modify their drawings. Repeat with additional figures.</p>
<p>Have a class discussion where children are asked to describe how they thought about the figure or give examples of attributes of the figure that helped them remember what they saw. As children learn to verbally describe what they see, their visual memory will improve. Support children with disabilities by having them identify the displayed figure from a set of figures that look similar.</p>

<p>The first of five figures is a square, divided diagonally with one part further divided into two for a total of 3 parts. The second shape is a quadrilateral with one side a diagonal and a square that shares two sides with one corner. The third shape is a triangle with an oval at each vertex. The fourth shape is an inverted isosceles triangle divided into 2 parts with a half circle on one end. The fifth shape is a square divided into 2 parts with a shaded circle in one half. </p></details>
<p>Finding out how many different shapes can be made with a given number of simple tiles requires that children mentally f lip and turn shapes in their minds and find ways to decide whether they have found them all. That is the focus of the next activity.</p>

<p><strong>CCSS-M: 1.G.A.2; 2.G.A.1</strong></p>
<p>A pentomino is a shape formed by joining five squares where each square must have at least one side in common with another. Provide children with five square tiles and a sheet of <a href="https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ab/ab_TED_eTexts/ted_etext_2018_sco/Van_de_Walle/BLM6_1-Centimeter_Grid_Paper.pdf" class="ulink">1-Centimeter Grid Paper</a> for recording. Challenge them to see how many different pentomino shapes they can find. Shapes that are flips or turns of other shapes are not considered different. Do not tell children how many pentomino shapes there are. Good discussions will come from deciding whether some shapes are really different and if all shapes have been found.</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page396" class="pagebreak" title="396" />Once children have decided that there are just 12 pentominoes (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_24">Figure 16.24</a>), the 12 pieces can be put on card stock and then be used in a variety of activities, such as the following.</p>

<p>The shapes on the grid are as follows: 5 in a horizontal row; a row of 3 with 1 above and 1 below the third square; 4 in a row with 1 below the third square; a column of 3 with a square left of the top and left of the bottom squares; a row of 3 squares with a square above and a square below the center square; a column of 3 with a row of 2 extending right from the top square; a row of 4 with a square above the fourth square; a 2 by 2 square with the fifth square right of the bottom row; a column of 3 squares with a square left of the top square and right of the middle square; a row of 3 with a square above the first square and below the last square; a row of 2 with a second row of 2 under the last square and a square below the last square; and a row of 3 with a row of two under the third square.</p></details>

</ul>
<p>Another good challenge for children is exploring the number of shapes that can be made from four (45-degree) right triangles (i.e., halves of squares) (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_25">Figure 16.25</a>), where sides that touch must be the same length. How many of each of these
&#8220;ominoes&#8221; do you think there are?</p>

<p>Four of the different shapes that four right triangles will make. The first shape is 1 larger right triangle. The second shape is two smaller right triangles that share the one side. The third shape is a square. The fourth shape is a small square with a small right triangle.</p></details>
<p>Based on an idea found in the NCTM&#8217;s <em>Principles and Standards for School Mathematics</em>
for prek&#8211;2 geometry, the next activity is a great example of how you can ask children to use their &#8220;mind&#8217;s eye&#8221; to predict the outcome of manipulating a shape.</p>

<p>Fold a sheet of paper in half and open it, showing children. Children are to make a sketch of the paper when it is opened, showing a line for the fold. Then display the folded paper on a projection unit and cut notches in one or two sides and/or cut off one or two corners. You can also use a paper punch to make a hole. While still folded, display the paper showing the notches and holes. The folded edge should be to the left (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_16_26">Figure 16.26</a>). Children are challenged to draw the notches and holes where they think they will appear when you open the paper.</p>

<p>Steps for the Notches and Holes activity are as follows. Step 1: fold paper, is a sheet of paper folded in half. Step 2: cut notches, has a triangular cutout sketched on the folded edge and opposite side with a diagonal in one corner. Step 3: show on projector, has the folded paper with cuts. Step 4: children draw their predictions, has a sheet of paper with a rhombus in the center and four triangle cutout, two on each side.</p></details>

<p>Try the &#8220;Notches and Holes&#8221; activity yourself. Make cuts in various places on the folded paper. Can you predict what the unfolded paper will look like?</p>
</aside>
<p><span id="page397" class="pagebreak" title="397" />The activity &#8220;Notches and Holes&#8221; can be modified for use with children who are at any level of geometric thought. To introduce this activity, begin with only one fold and only one cut. Adding additional cuts and additional folds increases the challenge. Predicting the result helps build visualization skills and is also very motivating!</p>
