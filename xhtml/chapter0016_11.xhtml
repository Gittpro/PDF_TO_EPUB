        <p>Visualization skills in three-dimensions can also be developed through the map-building activities that are
            used to help children learn about location. Consider the following task that you can pose just after your
            class returns to the classroom from another location in the building:</p>
        <aside class="sidebar sidebar_1" aria-label="sidenote_ch16-2">
            <p>Imagine that we are walking back to our classroom from the gym. What are some of the landmarks that we
                pass along the way?</p>
        </aside>
        <p><span id="page398" class="pagebreak" title="398" />After children have had time to visualize the path between
            the gym and their classroom, make a list of the landmarks that children thought of and take it with the
            class the next time you walk that path.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of visualization for young children is to be able to think about three-dimensional shapes in
            terms of their two-dimensional faces.</p>

                    16.27</a> for an example). (Alternatively, you can simply project each face of a 3-D object, one at
                a time, using a projection unit. Use a file folder to block the object from children&#8217;s view.)
                There are two versions of the task: Given a &#8220;Find a Shape&#8221; card, find the corresponding
                solid, or given a solid, find the matching &#8220;Find a Shape&#8221; card. With a collection of
                individual face cards, children can select the set of cards that go with a particular solid. For another
                variation, stack all of the individual face cards for one solid face down. Turn them up one at a time as
                clues to identifying the solid. Use the <a

            <p>Two examples of using face cards. Example ay, has a sheet with 3 rectangles and 2 triangles with a
                triangular prism and directions. Find a shape with those faces. Example b, has a set of five cards, each
                with a different shape and two pyramids and directions. Which cards do you need for each shape? How
                many?</p>

        <p>Visualization involves creating and manipulating mental images. You can use activities in the other geometry
            categories (e.g., shapes and properties, transformation, location) to help children improve their
            visualization skills simply by asking them to recall and describe a hidden shape, describe how a shape would
            look from a different viewpoint, and predict what will happen before they manipulate (e.g., decompose,
            compose, flip, slide, turn) shapes. Look for those opportunities as you plan lessons and as you interact
            with your children.</p>
