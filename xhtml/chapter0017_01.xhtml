        </header>
        <p>Doing statistics is, in fact, a different process from doing mathematics&#8212;a notion that has recently
            received much attention in standards documents and research (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_515"
                >Burrill &amp; Elliott, 2006</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_521"
                >Franklin et al., 2005</a>; <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_537"
                >Shaughnessy, 2003</a>). As <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_540"
                >Richard Scheaffer (2006)</a>, past president of the American Statistics
            Association, notes,</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Mathematics is about numbers and their operations, generalizations and abstractions; it is about spatial
                configurations and their measurement, transformations, and abstractions. . . . Statistics is also about
                numbers&#8212;but numbers in context: these are called data. Statistics is about variables and cases,
                distribution and variation, purposeful design or studies, and the role of randomness in the design of
                studies, and the interpretation of results. (pp. 310&#8211;311)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Students need to be statistically literate so they can make meaningful interpretations of the world. This
            section describes some of the big ideas and essential knowledge regarding statistics and explains the
            general process of doing statistics.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Is It Statistics or Mathematics?</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Statistics and mathematics are two different fields; however, statistical questions are often asked in
            assessments with questions that are mathematical in nature rather than statistical. The harm in this is that
            children are not focusing on statistical reasoning, as shown by the following exemplars from <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_540" >Scheaffer (2006)</a>.</p>
        <p>So, which of these problems involves statistical reasoning? Both? Neither? As explained by Schaeffer, only
            the second one is statistical in nature. The first requires computing with multiplication or using the
            formula for averages and working backward&#8212;which is mathematical thinking, not statistical thinking.
            The second question is statistical in nature because the situation requires analysis&#8212;graphs or
            averages might be used to determine a solution. The mathematics here is basic; the focus is on statistics.
            In particular, notice that the context is central to responding to the second question, which is an
            indication that it is statistical reasoning.<span id="page401" class="pagebreak" title="401" /></p>
