<h3 class="title">The Shape of Data</h3>
</header>
<p>A big conceptual idea in data analysis can be referred to as the shape of data: a sense of how data are spread out or clustered, what characteristics about the data set as a whole can be described, and what the data tell us in a global way about the population from which they are taken. Graphs, such as bar graphs and line plots, can illustrate the distributions (shape) of data (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_527" >Kader &amp; Jacobbe, 2013</a>). In the early grades, the shape of data can be discussed informally by looking at almost any graph. <a class="xref" href="#fig_17_1">Figure 17.1</a> shows six different line plots, each showing a different shape to the data. Although the line plot in <a class="xref" href="#fig_17_1">Figure 17.1(a)</a> is not exactly symmetrical, meaning the left side of the graph looks just like the right side, we would still describe it as symmetrical because we are describing the shape of the data in a general sense. In <a class="xref" href="#fig_17_1">Figure 17.1(c)</a>, we could say that the values cluster between 10 and 20, inclusive, and that 10 is the peak (mode), meaning it is the most frequently occurring value.</p>

<p>The six line plots have different distributions of data.  Each plot of the number of quarters in donation jars in different stores, has values, left to right, from 0 to 30, in increments of 5. For values, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30, each of the six plots has corresponding values as follows: Plot ay, symmetric, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 0. Plot b, uniform spread, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0. Plot c, cluster of values, 1, 0, 3, 2, 2, 0, 1. Plot d, outlier, 2, 3, 4, 2, 0, 0, 1. Plot e, right skew, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1. Plot f, left skew, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2.</p></details>
<p>Whenever there are two or more graphs of the same type (such as picture, bar, line plot), it is worth talking with children about the overall look of the graphs&#8212;how they are alike and how they are different&#8212;to help the children focus more on each data set as a whole. Consider, for example, the two graphs in <a class="xref" href="chapter0017_02.xhtml#fig_17_2">Figure 17.2</a>, showing data that have been gathered from a class of 25 children. In Our Favorite Spring Colors graph, although there is a most <span id="page402" class="pagebreak" title="402" />favored color, the data are essentially distributed equally or uniformly. In Our Favorite Sports graph, two sports received most of the votes from the class and the remainder of the class is somewhat spread among the other three categories.</p>

            <p>The bar graphs have squares stacked vertically. The first graph, our favorite spring colors, has a
                vertical axis for classmates and horizontal axis for colors. Left to right the colors and corresponding
                values are as follows: red 5, yellow 6, green 5, blue 5, orange 4. the second graph, our favorite sports
                has a vertical axis for classmates and a horizontal axis for sports. Left to right the colors and
                corresponding values are as follows: soccer 9, baseball 2, basketball 3, football 9, swimming 2.</p>

<p>When looking at graphs, young children tend to focus on a single data point, like their own. Lay sheer material, such as a curtain, over the data display so that children can still see the shape of the data but not individual pieces of data.</p>
</aside>
<p>Different graphing techniques or types of graphs can provide a different snapshot of the data as a whole. For example, bar graphs and circle graphs (percentage graphs) each show how the data cluster in different categories. The circle graph focuses more on the relative values of this clustering, whereas the bar graph adds a dimension of quantity. The choice of which and how many categories to use in these graphs will result in different pictures of the shape of the data.</p>
