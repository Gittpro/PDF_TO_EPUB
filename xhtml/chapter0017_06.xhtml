<h2 class="title">Data Collection</h2></header>
<p>There are two main types of data&#8212;<em>categorical</em> and <em>numerical</em>. Categorical data (as the name implies) are data grouped by labels (categories) such as favorite after-school activity, colors of cars in the school parking lot, and the most popular name for the class guinea pig. Categorical data are ordered arbitrarily&#8212;in other words, the bars in a bar graph could be put in any arrangement. Numerical data, on the other hand, count things or measures on a continuous scale. Numerical data are ordered numerically&#8212;for example on a number line&#8212;and can include fractions or decimals. This kind of data includes how many miles to school, the temperature in your town over a one-week period, or the weight of children&#8217;s backpacks.</p>

<p>When children initially collect data through observations or surveys, limit the number of possible choices to choose from.</p>

<h3 class="title">Collecting Data</h3>
</header>
<p>Gathering data is not easy for children, especially young children. How to collect good data is an important (and sometimes skipped) part of the discussion as children learn statistics. Consider the following scenario that addresses the importance of having these much-needed discussions. A teacher asked her first graders to gather data on &#8220;Are you 6?&#8221; After hearing the prompt, 18 eager children began asking others in the class if they were 6 and tallying yes or no responses. The problem? They had no idea whom they had asked more than once or whom they had not asked at all. This provided an excellent entry into a discussion about how statisticians gather data. Carolyn Cook, a kindergarten teacher, asked her children to help think of an organized way they could gather data from their classmates about their favorite f lavors of ice cream. These kindergartners decided a class list would help them keep track of who had been asked and what their response had been (see <a class="xref" href="chapter0017_06.xhtml#fig_17_4">Figure 17.4</a>) (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_518" >Cook, 2008</a>).</p>

            <p>A piece of paper has a list of student names with some names crossed off and pictures of ice cream cones
                with tally mark next them. A second paper has a bar graph with ice cream cone pictures stacked
                vertically, each with a row of connected rectangles that extends right with some of the rectangles
                colored in.</p>

<p>Children may start to collect data by counting objects or by hand raising, then move to using a ballot or survey with a limited number of response options and finally using a ballot or survey with unlimited response options (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_526" >Hudson, Shupe, Vasquez, &amp; Miller, 2008</a>). Data can also be collected through observation. This creates a shared context for children in that they all will be a part of observing phenomena. For example, set up a bird feeder outside the classroom window and collect data at different times during the <span id="page409" class="pagebreak" title="409" />day to count the number or type of birds that visit the feeder. Children can also collect observational data on field trips (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_531" >Mokros &amp; Wright, 2009</a>) and at evening or weekend activities with their families.</p>
