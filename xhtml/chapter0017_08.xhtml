            <h2 class="title">Data Analysis: Classification</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Data analysis begins with organizing the data in a meaningful way, using techniques such as sorting or
            graphing, with the resulting visual providing a snapshot of the data. The data are then analyzed with the
            goal in mind of how the information answers the questions that started the statistical inquiry and provided
            the purpose for collecting the data.</p>
        <p>Classification involves making decisions about how to categorize things, a basic activity that is fundamental
            to data analysis. In order to answer the questions being asked, decisions need to be made regarding how to
            represent and categorize the data that have been gathered. Young children initially might simply put the
            data in one list and not use categories to organize the data (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_517"
                >Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009</a>). For example, if children are asked to
            represent the class <span id="page410" class="pagebreak" title="410" />data about how children arrived at
            school, some children may simply list each child and their response. Therefore, discussions are necessary
            about how things might be categorized and how some categorizations might be more helpful than others in
            answering the questions being asked.</p>
        <p><em>Curriculum Focal Points</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_534" >National
                Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2006</a>) and the <em>Common Core State Standards</em> (CCSSO, 2010)
            identify classification by attributes as a topic for preK&#8211;K children. Children&#8217;s literature can
            offer a perfect lead-in to sorting activities. For example, <em>Frog and Toad are Friends</em> (<a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_530" >Lobel, 1970</a>) is a classic story about
            friends who help search for Frog&#8217;s missing button. Whenever Frog&#8217;s friends ask, &#8220;Is this
            your button?&#8221; Frog responds (with a touch of frustration), &#8220;No, that is not my button! That
            button is ____, but my button was ____.&#8221; Children can use Frog&#8217;s descriptions to sort a
            collection of buttons. One pre-K teacher used the children&#8217;s book <em>Whose Shoes? A Shoe for Every
                Job</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_544" >Swinburne, 2011</a>) to create
            a context for children to categorize their shoes. (Watch this <strong>video</strong> (<a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezaUlqc_xzw&amp;list=PLRY-hkA40X06NRPAADyqsG-FWoNwfU3Sq&amp;index=2"
                class="ulink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezaUlqc_xzw&amp;list=PLRY-hkA40X06NRPAADyqsG-FWoNwfU3Sq&amp;index=2</a>)
            of these young learners deciding on categories for their shoes.) Attribute activities, the topic of the next
            section, are another way to provide opportunities for children to think about classification. Attribute
            materials are explicitly designed to develop f lexible reasoning about the characteristics of data.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Classifications Using Attribute Materials</h3>
        </header>
        <p><em>Attribute materials</em> can be any set of objects that lend themselves to being sorted and classified in
            different ways&#8212;for example, seashells, leaves, children&#8217;s shoes, or the children themselves. The
            <em>attributes</em> are the ways that the materials can be sorted. For example, hair color, height, and
            gender are attributes of children. Each attribute has a number of different <em>values</em>: for example,
            blond, brown, or red (for the attribute of hair color); tall or short (for height); male or female (for
            gender). Commercially available attribute blocks come in sets of 60 pieces, with each piece having four
            attributes: color (red, yellow, blue), shape (circle, triangle, rectangle, square, hexagon), size (big,
            little), and thickness (thick, thin). The specific values, number of values, or number of attributes that a
            set may have is not important.

        </aside>
        <p>Initially, attribute activities are best done by sitting in a large circle on the f loor where all children
            can see and have access to the materials to be sorted. The following activity is a simple Venn diagram
            activity that preK&#8211;1 children will enjoy.</p>

            <p>Give children two large loops of string and attribute blocks. Direct them to put all the red pieces
                inside one string and all triangles inside the other. Let the children try to resolve the difficulty of
                what to do with the red triangles. When the notion of overlapping the strings to create an area common
                to both loops is clear, more challenging activities can be explored. It will be helpful, especially for
                children with disabilities, to place labels on each loop of the string.</p>
            <p>In addition to attribute blocks, you can use Woozle Cards (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_17_5">Figure
                    17.5</a>). To make the cards, copy the <a

                on one page the same color, then another page in another color, etc., to have color as an attribute for

                described for the attribute blocks.</p>

            <p>Digital versions of attribute blocks can be found by visiting the National Library of Virtual
                Manipulatives (NLVM) or Glencoe&#8217;s Virtual Manipulative website. The NLVM applet provides several
                classification problems for children to do. They are shown a set of blocks inside a loop having the same
                shape, size, or color. Their task is to drag inside the loop other blocks that belong according to the
                target attribute.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>As children progress, make sure to introduce labels for negative attributes such as &#8220;not red&#8221; or
            &#8220;not small.&#8221; Also important is the eventual use of <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> connectives to
            form two-value rules such as &#8220;red and square&#8221; and &#8220;big or happy.&#8221; This use of
            <em>and, or,</em> and <em>not</em> significantly widens children&#8217;s classification schemes.
        </p>
        <p>An engaging and challenging activity is to infer how things have been classified when the loops are not
            labeled. The following activities require children to make and test conjectures about how things are being
            classified.</p>

            <p>For this activity, try using children instead of shapes as attribute &#8220;pieces.&#8221; Decide on an
                attribute such as &#8220;blue jeans&#8221; or &#8220;stripes on clothing&#8221; but do not tell your
                rule to the class. Silently look at one child at a time and move the child to the left or right according to this secret
                rule. After a number of children have been sorted, have the next child come up and ask children to
                predict in which group he or she belongs. Before the rule is articulated, continue the activity for a
                while so that others in the class will have an opportunity to determine the rule. The same activity can
                be done with virtually any materials that can be sorted, such as children&#8217;s shoes, shells, or
                buttons. Encourage ELLs to use their native language and English to describe the rule.</p>

                represents the rules you will use for sorting. Ask children to select a piece for you to place. For ELLs
                and children with disabilities, provide a list of the labels with pictures and/or translations for each
                as a reference. Begin to sort pieces according to the hidden rules. As you sort, have children try to
                determine what the labels are for each of the loops. Let children who think they have guessed the labels
                try to place a piece in the proper loop but avoid having them guess the labels aloud. Children who think
                they know the labels can be asked to &#8220;play teacher&#8221; and respond to the guesses of others.
                Point out that one way to test an idea about the labels is to select a piece that you think might go in
                a particular section. Wait to turn the label cards up until most children have figured out the rule.
