</header>
<p>&#8220;Guess My Rule&#8221; and &#8220;Hidden Labels&#8221; can and should be repeated with real-world materials connected to other content areas and to children&#8217;s experiences. For example, if you are doing a unit on wildlife in the backyard, you can use pictures of creatures (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_17_7">Figure 17.7</a>) to sort by relevant attributes and have children guess the sorting rule. To connect reading and data, children can sort and analyze data within a book (e.g., kinds of animals, shapes, locations). Children can also keep track of the kinds of books they read as a class (by topic area) or the number of times different words are used in a story. Children can bring in things they can recycle and these objects can be sorted by type (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_519" >English, 2013</a>). <a class="xref" href="chapter0017_03.xhtml#Tab_17_3">Table 17.3</a> lists additional ideas that can be used for classification activities related to social studies and science. Using ideas related to content and the real world helps children understand that data analysis is useful as well as engaging!</p>

<p>The ability to classify is an important skill for early data analysis. You can assess your children&#8217;s classification skills by observing them in small groups and listening to children as they participate in full-class discussions. Require children to explain their reasoning for placement of items. Here are some suggestions for what to listen and look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>After gathering data, do children use categories to sort the data or do they just list the information (e.g., list each child in the class and their favorite ice cream)?
</li>
<li>Are children able to place items into categories once the categories have been identified?
Do they use valid reasons for placing items in a category?</li>
<li>Do children contribute to ideas for classification schemes?</li>
<li>Do children understand that different classification schemes will result in a different organization of the items being sorted? For example, children&#8217;s names may be sorted by number of letters, and they can also be sorted by which part of the alphabet they begin with&#8212;first half or second half. These two schemes would result in different classifications.</li>
<li>Do children correctly use an overlapping category&#8212;items that belong to two different groups at the same time?</li>
<li>Can children correctly use the logical connectors <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> and the adjective <em>not</em>
when creating classifications?</li>
</ul>
