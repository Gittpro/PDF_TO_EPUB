<h2 class="title">Data Analysis: Graphical Representations</h2></header>
<p>Graphs summarize the data that were collected, providing a visual image of the data that cannot be captured in other forms. In the CCSS-M (2010), representing and interpreting data begins in grade 1, but preK&#8211;K children first experience a form of graphical representation <span id="page414" class="pagebreak" title="414" /><span id="z16-8">when they use loops to categorize attribute materials. PreK&#8211;2 classes can &#8220;graph&#8221; data about themselves by placing information in loops with labels. A graph of &#8220;Our Pets&#8221; might consist of a picture of each child&#8217;s pet or favorite stuffed animal (in lieu of a pet) that can be affixed to a wall display showing how the pets were classified. </span></p>
<p>How data are organized should be directly related to the question that caused you to collect the data in the first place. For example, suppose that children want to know how many pockets they have on their clothing (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_536" >Russell, 2006</a>). Data collection involves each child in the room counting his or her pockets.</p>

<p>If your second-grade class had collected these data, what methods might you suggest they use for organizing and graphing them? Is one of these ideas better than others for answering the question about how many pockets?</p>
</aside>
<p>Different classifications would produce different graphs. A bar graph made with one bar for every child will certainly tell how many pockets each child has. However, is it the best way to answer the question? If the data were categorized by number of pockets, then a graph showing the number of children with no pockets, one pocket, two pockets, three pockets, and so on will easily show which number of pockets is most common and how the number of pockets varies across the class.</p>

<h3 class="title">Creating Graphs</h3>
</header>
<p>Children should be involved in deciding how they want to represent their data. However, for children with little experience with the various methods of picturing data, you will need to introduce options. Graph the data using these options and facilitate a discussion with the class to decide which method might be best and why.</p>
<p>Creating graphs requires care and precision, including determining appropriate scale and labels, so that an audience is able to see at a glance the summary of the data gathered for a particular question. Once children have made the graph, the most important activity is discussing the meanings of various parts of the representation and what it tells people who see it. Analyzing data that are numerical (number of pockets) as opposed to categorical (color of socks) is an added challenge for children as they struggle to make sense of the graphs (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_536" >Russell, 2006</a>). If, for example, the graph has three stickers above the five, children may think that five people have three pockets or three people have five pockets (see <a class="xref" href="#fig_17_8">Figure 17.8</a>). Children should be challenged to determine how this issue can be remedied.</p>

<p>Often, young children have difficulty distinguishing between the data and the larger event from which the data were collected. They think of the data as triggers or &#8220;pointers&#8221; to the event, not as specific information about the event (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_528" >Konold, Higgins, Russell, &amp; Khalil, 2004</a>). For example, instead of recognizing that more children in the class have two pockets than five pockets, they may describe how they can put their lunch money in their front pocket or that they counted their pockets by twos. Focusing on the meaning of the symbols used in a graphical representation of the data as well as<span id="page415" class="pagebreak" title="415" /> having children make comparisons between different groups (e.g., How many pockets do fifth graders have?) can help make the intent of the graph more salient for children (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_536" >Russell, 2006</a>).</p>
<p>The value of having children construct their own graphs is not so much that they learn the techniques as that they are personally invested in the data and that they learn how a graph conveys information. What we should <em>not</em> do is only concentrate on the details of graph construction. Your objectives should also focus on the issues of analysis and communication.</p>

<header><h2 class="title" id="ch_17_tech_note_02">Technology Note</h2></header>

<p>Children should construct graphs or charts by hand and with technology. Use the time saved by technology to focus on discussions about the information provided by each graph. The Data Grapher on NCTM&#8217;s Illuminations website provides tools to create pictographs and bar graphs.</p>
