<h3 class="title">Analyzing Graphs</h3>
</header>
<p>Once a graph has been constructed, engage the class in a discussion of what information the graph tells or conveys&#8212;this is the analysis. Questioning and assessment should focus on how effectively the graph communicates the findings of the data gathered. For example, ask, &#8220;What can you tell about our class by looking at this graph of the number of books read in one week?&#8221; Graphs convey factual information (e.g., there is a wide variability in the number of books first graders read in one week) and also provide opportunities to make inferences that are not directly observable in the graph (e.g., most first graders read between five and seven books in one week). Discussions about graphs that children have created help them analyze and interpret other graphs and charts that they see in newspapers and on TV. For example, you can select simple graphs from newspapers or websites and ask children &#8220;What can you learn from this graph?&#8221; &#8220;What do you not know that you wish you knew?&#8221; These questions help children focus on what different graphs can and cannot illustrate.</p>
<p>The difference between <em>actual facts</em> and the <em>inferences that go beyond the data</em> is an important idea in data analysis. Children can examine graphs found in newspapers or magazines and discuss the facts in the graphs and the message that may have been intended by the person who made the graph. Children&#8217;s conceptual ability to analyze data and draw conclusions and interpretations is often weak <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_545" >(Tarr &amp; Shaughnessy, 2007)</a>; discussing and analyzing data is a way to support this higher-level thinking skill.</p>
