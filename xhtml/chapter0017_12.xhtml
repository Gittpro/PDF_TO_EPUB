        </header>
        <p>The following progression for introducing different kinds of graphs in grades preK&#8211;2
            is recommended based on research findings <a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_523"
                >(Friel, Curcio, and Bright, 2001)</a>:</p>
        <ol class="numbered">
            <li>
                <p>Object graphs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Picture graphs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Line plots</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bar graphs</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>All of these types of graphs help children focus on the count or frequency for each value along the vertical
            scale. However, at first glance, this progression does not follow the one recommended in the <em>Common Core
                State Standards</em> (<a class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" >CCSSO, 2010</a>)
            and the <em>Curriculum Focal Points</em> (<span id="page416" class="pagebreak" title="416" /><a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_534" >National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,
                2006</a>) because line plots appear after bar graphs in both of these documents&#8212;very likely
            because object, picture, and bar graphs all deal with categorical data while line plots are for numerical
            data. The recommended progression above moves from graphs where each piece of data is evident (object
            graphs, picture graphs, and line plots) to bar graphs where the individual data values seem to
            disappear&#8212;at least from the perspective of a child. We recommend having children work simultaneously
            with both line plots and bar graphs with explicit individual data rather than having children avoid asking
            questions that require numerical data (and a line plot). This way children can ask interesting questions
            that may require either categorical or numerical data to answer.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Object Graphs</h4>
        </header>
        <p>An object graph uses the actual objects being graphed. Examples include types of shoes, favorite fruit, and
            shapes of buttons. A large graph mat with square grids can be used on the f loor to display the objects in
            an organized manner. (You can use a plastic shower liner for the mat and electrical tape to create the
            grids.) Each item is placed in a square so that comparisons and counts are easily made. Notice that an
            object graph is a small step from sorting. If real objects are sorted into groups, those groups can be lined
            up for comparison&#8212;an object graph! This <strong>video</strong> (<a

            demonstrates how a teacher introduces an object graph to help preschoolers organize their shoes to better
            answer their questions.</p>
        <header>
            <h4 class="title">Picture Graphs</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Picture graphs (also called pictographs) move up a level of abstraction by using a drawing or picture of some
            sort that represents what is being graphed. The picture can represent one piece of data or it can represent
            a designated quantity. For example, a picture of a book can be assigned to mean five books in a graph of how
            many books were read each day of the week. When children view the graph and see four books for Monday, they
            skip count to determine that twenty books were read on Monday. This
            <strong>video</strong> (<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_1611844189&amp;feature=iv&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLRY-hkA40X06NRPAADyqsGFWoNwfU3Sq&amp;src_vid=4SIY1-idRqY&amp;v=Z6ZnsCZJSzQ"

            demonstrates how preschoolers are able to transition from object graphs to picture graphs.
        </p>
        <p>Children can make their own drawings for picture graphs; however, if you find this too time consuming, there
            are various ways to make picture graphs easier to create, and thereby keep the focus on the meaning of the
            graph rather than the creation of it. Some suggestions are to use stickers, clip art (copied repeatedly on a
            page that can then be cut out), or shapes cut out with a die-cut.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Bar Graphs</h4>
        </header>
        <p>After object and picture graphs, bar graphs are among the first ways used to group and present data with
            children in grades preK&#8211;2. To help transition from object and picture graphs to bar graphs, have
            children use something to represent the pieces of data or the things being counted. An easy idea is to use
            Post-It notes to represent the individual pieces of data. These can be stuck directly to the board or to a
            chart and rearranged if needed. To help children keep their notes in line you may wish to use a gridded
            chart similar to the graph mat described in the section on object graphs. <a class="xref"
                href="#fig_17_9">Figure 17.9</a> illustrates a few ideas that can be used to make a graph quickly with
            the whole class.</p>

                long and used on the floor. Make 5 or 6 columns with 12 to 15 squares in each column. Children place
                real objects in the columns to show the number of each. A chart of children in family has values in 4
                squares across the top for the number of children. A ribbon is hung below each with marks at even
                intervals for placing clothespins. Children clip on pinch style clothespins.</p>

        <p><span id="page417" class="pagebreak" title="417" />For preK&#8211;2 children, it is reasonable to have
            between two to six different bars in a graph. Initially bar graphs should be made with each bar consisting
            of countable parts so that the individual pieces of data do not seem to disappear. The Post-it notes in the
            next activity, &#8220;Picture Graphs to Bar Graphs,&#8221; serve this purpose.</p>

            <p>Determine a question that lends itself to pre-set categories and is of interest to children (e.g.,
                favorite sport, ice cream, pet type). Ask children to draw a picture to represent their category (say,
                the ball that goes with their favorite sport) on a sticky note, place their sticky note in a
                &#8220;row&#8221; on the white board (or wall) so that there is a little space between them. Invite
                children to make observations about their picture graph. Discuss with the class how they might make a
                bar graph to illustrate their data. Move the sticky notes so there is no space between them and they
                look like a bar. Discuss ways to know how long the bar is and add a scale next to the bars to show the
                height (or length) of each bar.</p>

        <p>Bar graphs can also be a source for creating put-together, take-apart, and comparison word problems.</p>

            <p>Have children make a bar graph of some data using linking cubes. Choose a situation with 5 or 6 bars with
                no more than 10 or 12 cubes in each. For example, the graph in <a class="xref" href="#fig_17_10">Figure
                    17.10</a> shows prices for six toys. The task for children is to use the graph itself to create at
                least two story problems about the toy prices. For example, one problem might be &#8220;How much more
                money does the doll cost than the football?&#8221; Another problem could be &#8220;If you had $20, which
                toys could you buy? How much change would you get back?&#8221; Children can swap their story problems
                with a partner or you can pose some of their problems to the entire class.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Line Plots</h4>
        </header>
        <p>Object, picture, and bar graphs are useful for illustrating categorical data, for example, favorite colors or
            TV shows. When data are numerical (i.e., grouped along a continuous scale), they should be ordered along a
            number line.</p>
        <p>Line plots, introduced in the CCSS-M standards in grade 2 using whole-number units <a
                class="noteref_biblioref" href="bibliography.xhtml#ref_366" >(CCSSO, 2010)</a> are counts of things along
            a numeric scale. To make a line plot, a number line is drawn and an X is made above the corresponding value
            on the line for every corresponding data element (in middle school and beyond the X is replaced by dots and
            the graph is then called a <em>dot plot</em>). (Watch this <strong>video</strong> (<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHCBtKFhV8M"
                    class="unlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHCBtKFhV8M</a>) about making line plots.)
            One advantage of a line plot is that every piece of data is shown on the graph, making it is a very easy
            type of graph for children to make. A line plot is essentially a bar graph arranged along a <span
                id="page419" class="pagebreak" title="419" />numerical scale with a potential bar for every indicated
            whole-number value on the horizontal scale. An example of a line plot is shown in <a class="xref"

            <p>A common error that children make, especially when using technology to create graphs, is to use a line
                graph instead of a line plot. In line graphs we assume that the points on the line between the
                identified values are feasible values (e.g., those temperatures were passed through on the way from one
                identified value to the next). Data used with line plots are not continuous in that sense.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>To introduce line plots in a concrete manner, relate them to picture graphs, but use a numeric scale rather
            than a categorical scale, as done in the next activity. Having children be &#8220;in the graph&#8221; is
            also an important experience that will enable them to better understand the more abstract graphical
            representation.</p>

                ranging from 2 minutes to 20 minutes (or whatever is appropriate for your children). Have children write
                on a Post-it note how many minutes it takes them to travel to school. By groups, ask children to stand
                on the location above that number in a line. Encourage peers to confirm their neighbors are standing in
                the correct place. Then ask children to leave their Post-it note at the number where they are standing
                and sit down. Recreate the line plot on an interactive white board or use the Post-it notes to recreate
                the line plot above a line drawn on the board. (Label the line with the same numbers as the masking tape
                line, e.g., 2 minutes to 20 minutes.) Have children create the line plot on their own paper. Ask
                children questions about their data (e.g., how many more or less in one category than another). As a
                summary, ask children to write one observation about the data. ELLs and children with disabilities will
                benefit from one sentence starters such as, &#8220;I notice that

        <p>Line plots, because of the numerical scale, can be used to show measurements. Second graders are expected to
            generate measurements of objects to the nearest whole unit (CCSSO, 2010). They might measure to the nearest
            inch and plot, for example, their foot length, their cubit (length of forearm from elbow to finger tips),
            the height of their desk, and so on. Data can also be gathered from plants growing, time passing, or
            weather, as in the next activity.</p>

                storm total in October compare to the total in February? If you don&#8217;t want to take months
                gathering data, instead look up the rain/snow fall in various cities/towns after a storm has passed
                through and use that to create a storm plot.</p>
