<p>The late <strong>John A. Van de Walle</strong> was a professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University. He was a mathematics education consultant who regularly gave professional development workshops for K&#8211;8 teachers in the United States and Canada. He visited and taught in elementary school classrooms and worked with teachers to implement student-centered math lessons. He coauthored the Scott Foresman-Addison Wesley Mathematics K&#8211;6 series and contributed to the Pearson School mathematics program, enVisionMATH. In addition, he wrote numerous chapters and articles for the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) books and journals and was very active in NCTM, including serving on the Board of Directors, as the chair of the Educational Materials Committee, and as a frequent speaker at national and regional meetings.</p>

<p><strong>LouAnn H. Lovin</strong> is a professor of mathematics education at James Madison University (Virginia). She coauthored the first edition of the <em>Teaching Student-Centered Mathematics</em> Professional Development Series with John A. Van de Walle as well as <em>Teaching Mathematics Meaningfully: Solutions for Reaching Struggling Learners</em> (2nd ed.) with David Allsopp and Sarah Vaningen. LouAnn taught mathematics to middle and high school students before transitioning to preK&#8211;grade 8. For almost twenty years, she has worked in preK through grade 8 classrooms and engaged with teachers in professional development as they implement a student-centered approach to teaching mathematics. She has published articles in <em>Teaching Children Mathematics</em>, <em>Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School, Teaching Exceptional Children,</em> and <em>Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education</em> and has served on NCTM&#8217;s Educational Materials Committee. LouAnn&#8217;s research on teachers&#8217; mathematical knowledge for teaching has focused most recently on the developmental nature of prospective teachers&#8217; fraction knowledge.</p>
