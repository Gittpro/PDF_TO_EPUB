<p>All children can learn mathematics with understanding! We believe that teachers can and must create learning environments in which children have this experience. Effective mathematics instruction involves posing worthwhile tasks that will engage children in the mathematics they are expected to learn. Then, by allowing children to interact with and productively struggle with the mathematics using <em>their</em> ideas and <em>their</em> strategies&#8212;a student-centered approach&#8212;children will develop a robust understanding of the mathematics. As they learn to see the connections among mathematical topics and to their world, children will value mathematics and feel empowered to use it. The title of this book, <em>Teaching Student-Centered Mathematics: Developmentally Appropriate Instruction for Grades PreK&#8211;2,</em> reflects this vision. Part 1 of this book is dedicated to addressing how to build a student-centered environment in which children can become mathematically proficient and Part 2 elaborates on how that environment can be realized across all content in the grades PreK&#8211;2 mathematics curriculum.</p>
